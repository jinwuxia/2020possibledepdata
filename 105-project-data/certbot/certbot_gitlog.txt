    Merge pull request #6786 from certbot/pin-deps_continued
    
    This continues from the work of @sydneyli in PR #6671
    I didn't do much here. Basically added support for reading data from sys.stdin to both tools/merge_requirements.py and tools/strip_hashes.py as well as support for reading files from paths passed as cli parameters to strip_hashes.py.
    
    Reading the filepaths was not strictly required, but I thought would be a good thing to do in order to keep the tooling usage options consistent.
    
    Fixes #6581

    Cover case of OpenSUSE Leap 15+ in certbot-auto (#6794)
    
    Fixes #6228.
    
    Since OpenSUSE Leap 15, python-virtualenv became a source package, breaking certbot-auto bootstrap on this version. Then python2-virtualenv must be used to create Python 2.x virtual environments.
    
    This PR makes certbot-auto compatible to prior and after Leap 15, by testing the existence of python-virtualenv on current OpenSUSE system, and then use appropriate packages.

    Revert "Disable build for commits pushed on master (#6804)" (#6807)
    
    By removing all the builds on push to master, done in #6804, we also removing the coveralls reports that are necessary to calculate the effect of a PR on code coverage, that is part of the quality gate process.
    
    This PR is reverting #6804, and another implementation preserving the coveralls reports will be done soon.
    
    This reverts commit a468a3b255e326dbfa2b7d629eb20fa275631254.

    Implement Retry-After, and refactor authorization polling (#6766)
    
    Fixes #5789
    
    This PR is about allowing Certbot to respect the Retry-After HTTP header that an ACME CA server can return to a client POSTing to a challenge, to instruct him and retry the request later.
    
    However, this feature was not easily implementable in the current code of certbot.auth_handler, because the code became really hard to read. In fact, @bmw was thinking that the code was really deceiving, and a lot of supposed functionalities declared in the comments were in fact not implemented or not functional.
    
    So I took the time to understand what was going on, and effectively, most of the code is in fact not usable or not used. Then I did a refactoring against the bare ACME spec about what to do to prepare challenges, instruct the ACME CA server to perform them, then polling regularly the authorization resources until they are decided (valid or invalid).
    
    And of course this implementation takes care of Retry-After ^^
    
    I added a lot of comments in the new implementation, to explain what is going on for a future developer. The workflow I used is relying on the relationships between authorizations and challenges states as described in section 7.1.6 of the ACME spec draft: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-acme-acme/
    
    * Clean auth_handler a bit, and implement retry-after.

    Disable build for commits pushed on master (#6804)
    
    Fixes #6746.
    
    Every commit on master is always the result of a merged PR, that has been tested by Travis. So retesting the merge commit on master is superfluous. This PR uses build conditions to avoid to launch a build for a commit push on master.
    
    I also added the equivalent logic for AppVeyor. Builds cannot received conditions, so it needs to be done on init using Exit-AppVeyorBuild. This command does not fail the build, it finishes it prematurely with success.
    
    * Disable build for commit pushed on master (PR are still tested of course)
    
    * Equivalent exclusion code for AppVeyor

    Fix the Nginx configuration during integration tests (#6801)
    
    If you execute `tests/lock_test.py` or `tox -e integration` on a fairly recent machine, you will get the following error during tests executing against a live Nginx instance:
    ```
    no "ssl_certificate" is defined in server listening on SSL port while SSL handshaking, client: x.x.x.x, server: y:y:y:y:z
    ```
    
    Indeed, having no defined ssl certificate for a ssl port would inevitably lead to an error during the handshake SSL process between a client and this mis-configured nginx instance.
    
    However it was not a problem one year before, because the handshake was not occurring in practice: the test just need to have a nginx started, and then immediately proceed to modify the configuration with a correct SSL setup. And nginx was able to start with a mis-configuration on SSL.
    
    But then this fix has been done: https://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/178
    
    Basically with this, validation of the configuration is done during nginx startup, that will refuse to start with invalid configuration on SSL. Consequently, all related tests are failing with a sufficiently up-to-date nginx. For now, it is not seen on Travis because Ubuntu Trusty is used, with an old Nginx.
    
    The PR fixes that, by generating on the fly self-signed certificates in the two impacted tests, and pushing the right parameters in the Nginx configuration.
    
    * Fix nginx configuration with self-signed certificates generated on the fly
    
    * Fix lint/mypy
    
    * Fix old cryptography

    Disable rerun feature of Travis (#6800)
    
    The rerun capability in a test campaign can be a nice feature. It can also a bad design.
    
    It is right that with high level tests, like performance or end-to-end tests, a given test runtime can depend on an external component, outside the scope of the developers, that would spuriously fail. In theses situations, having the capacity to rerun several time a test can be a great benefit. Indeed, as these tests are inherently flaky, the rerun greatly reduces their failure because of external reasons, reducing also the Pierre et le Loup effect (from a well-known french book for children): because tests constantly fail for no reason, you stop to listen to them and to not see when they fail for a real reason.
    
    However this not apply to unit tests, or operations about code quality. For theses executions, the flakiness should not exist: a unit test is supposed to have no external dependency. A rerun approach would just hide a situation that is not desirable for this kind of tests
    
    Also effectively I see that our tests are usually not flaky: so the only effect of the rerun is to give the failure state about a test three times slower. If a test becomes flaky, this should be fixed, and so be visible immediately in our CI.
    
    For these reasons, I remove the travis_retry in the script section of .travis-ci.yml, to call directly tox and let the pipeline fails on the first error.
    
    * Disable rerun feature of Travis
    
    * Update .travis.yml
    
    * Remove completely the retry logic

    Remove keyAuthorization field from the challenge response JWS token (#6758)
    
    Fixes #6755.
    
    POSTing the `keyAuthorization` in a JWS token when answering an ACME challenge, has been deprecated for some time now. Indeed, this is superfluous as the request is already authentified by the JWS signature.
    
    Boulder still accepts to see this field in the JWS token, and ignore it. Pebble in non strict mode also. But Pebble in strict mode refuses the request, to prepare complete removal of this field in ACME v2.
    
    Certbot still sends the `keyAuthorization` field. This PR removes it, and makes Certbot compliant with current ACME v2 protocol, and so Pebble in strict mode.
    
    See also [letsencrypt/pebble#192](https://github.com/letsencrypt/pebble/issues/192) for implementation details server side.

    Fix test sdists with atexit handlers (#6769)
    
    So merging the study from @bmw and me, here is what happened.
    
    Each invocation of `certbot.logger.post_arg_parse_setup` create a file handler on `letsencrypt.log`. This function also set an atexit handler invoking `logger.shutdown()`, that have the effect to close all logger file handler not already closed at this point. This method is supposed to be called when a python process is close to exit, because it makes all logger unable to write new logs on any handler.
    
    Before #6667 and this PR, for tests, the atexit handle would be triggered only at the end of the pytest process. It means that each test that launches `certbot.logger.post_arg_parse_setup` add a new file handler. These tests were typically connecting the file handler on a `letsencrypt.log` located in a temporary directory, and this directory and content was wipped out at each test tearDown. As a consequence, the file handles, not cleared from the logger, were accumulating in the logger, with all of them connected to a deleted file log, except the last one that was just created by the current test. Considering the number of tests concerned, there were ~300 file handler at the end of pytest execution.
    
    One can see that, on prior #6667, by calling `print(logger.getLogger().handlers` on the `tearDown` of these tests, and see the array growing at each test execution.
    
    Even if this represent a memory leak, this situation was not really a problem on Linux: because a file can be deleted before it is closed, it was only meaning that a given invocation of `logger.debug` for instance, during the tests, was written in 300 log files. The overhead is negligeable. On Windows however, the file handlers were failing because you cannot delete a file before it is closed.
    
    It was one of the reason for #6667, that added a call to `logging.shutdown()` at each test tearDown, with the consequence to close all file handlers. At this point, Linux is not happy anymore. Any call to `logger.warn` will generate an error for each closed file handler. As a file handler is added for each test, the number of errors grows on each test, following an arithmetical suite divergence.
    
    On `test_sdists.py`, that is using the bare setuptools test suite without output capturing, we can see the damages. The total output takes 216000 lines, and 23000 errors are generated. A decent machine can support this load, but a not a small AWS instance, that is crashing during the execution. Even with pytest, the captured output and the memory leak become so large that segfaults are generated.
    
    On the current PR, the problem is solved, by resetting the file handlers array on the logging system on each test tearDown. So each fileHandler is properly closed, and removed from the stack. They do not participate anymore in the logging system, and can be garbage collected. Then we stay on always one file handler opened at any time, and tests can succeed on AWS instances.
    
    For the record, here is all the places where the logging system is called and fail if there is still file handlers closed but not cleaned (extracted from the original huge output before correction):

    [Windows] Fixes lock_and_call test method (#6772)
    
    The method `lock_and_call`, in `certbot.tests.util` is designed to acquire a lock on a foreign process, then execute a callable in the current process. This is done to closely reproduce the lock mechanism involved between two certbot instances that are running in parallel.
    
    This method uses the `multiprocessing` module. But its implementation in `lock_and_call` is broken for Windows: the two processes fail to communicate, leading to a deadlock.
    
    In fact, `multiprocessing` module is using the fork mechanism on Linux, and the spawn mechanism on Windows, leading to behavior inconsistencies between the two platforms.
    
    As this method is for tests, and not for production code, I did not try to make two implementations "by the book", one suitable for Windows, the other for Linux, like for the `certbot.lock` module.
    
    Instead, I use a `subprocess` approach with a trigger file allowing to coordinate the current process and the subprocess. With this, `lock_and_call` is running from the same code both on Linux and Windows.
    
    Relevant tests in the `certbot.tests.lock_test` test module are now enabled for Windows.
    
    * Implement new lock_and_call method
    
    * Reactivate tests for Windows

    [Windows|Unix] New platform independent locking mechanism - the revenge (#6663)
    
    First PR about this issue, #6440, involved to much refactoring to ensure a correct behavior on Linux and installer plugins.
    
    This PR proposes a new implementation of a lock mechanism for Linux and Windows, without implying a refactoring. It takes strictly the existing behavior for Linux, and add the appropriate logic for Windows. The `lock` module formalizes two independant mechanism dedicated to each platform, to improve maintainability.
    
    Tests related to locking are re-activated for Windows, or definitively skipped because of irrelevancy for this platform. 6 more tests are enabled overall.
    
    * Reimplement lock file on basic level
    
    * Remove unused code
    
    * Re-activate some tests
    
    * Update doc
    
    * Reactivate tests relevant to locks in Windows. Correct a test that was not testing what is supposed to test.

    Test all on push events to tested non-master branches. (#6741)
    
    We always run a full set of CI tests before beginning the release process. The way this would work previously is we would either trigger tests on the `test-everything` branch to run through Travis' web UI or if it was a point release, create a new branch based on `test-everything` but modify `.travis.yml` so the branch that was pulled in to be tested was the point release branch instead of `master`.
    
    This no longer works because the former `test-everything` tests are now only run when Travis automatically runs our tests nightly.
    
    We could create and maintain a separate branch for the purpose of manually running all tests or remove the conditionals from the latest `.travis.yml` file every time before we want to run these tests, but there must be A Better Way™.
    
    This PR makes the change that in addition to running all tests nightly, they would also run on pushes to tested branches other than master. These changes do not affect the tests run on PRs or on commits to `master`.
    
    What is affected is commits to point release branches and branches named `test-*`. (See [.travis.yml](https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/2ddaf3db043ea8526ae3f9ab2ef120b194b2e506/.travis.yml#L177) for what branches we run tests on.) Running all tests on point release branches automates the step of running our full test suite before doing a point release.
    
    The changes to `test-*` could be a mixed bag, however, since we switched to travis-ci.com over 3 weeks ago, I'm the only one who has used this functionality and I personally prefer things this way. At the very least, since these branches don't seem to be widely used, I think we can make this change and reevaluate if it becomes a problem.

    Apache plugin: configure all matching domain names to be able to answer HTTP challenge. (#6729)
    
    Attempts to configure all of the following VirtualHosts for answering the HTTP challenge:
    
    * VirtualHosts that have the requested domain name in either `ServerName` or `ServerAlias` directive.
    * VirtualHosts that have a wildcard name that would match the requested domain name.
    
    This also applies to HTTPS VirtualHosts, making Apache plugin able to handle cases where HTTP redirection takes place in reverse proxy or similar, before reaching the Apache HTTPD.
    
    Even though also HTTPS VirtualHosts are selected, Apache plugin tries to ensure that at least one of the selected VirtualHosts listens to HTTP-01 port (configured with `--http-01-port` CLI option). So in a case where only HTTPS VirtualHosts exist, but user wants to configure those, `--http-01-port` parameter needs to be set for the port configured to the HTTPS VirtualHost(s).
    
    Fixes: #6730
    
    * Select all matching VirtualHosts for HTTP-01 challenges instead of just one
    
    * Finalize PR and add tests
    
    * Changelog entry

    Use built-in support for OCSP in cryptography >= 2.5 (#6603)
    
    In response to #6594. [Fixes #6594.]
    
    To execute OCSP requests, certbot relies currently on a openssl binary execution. If openssl is not present in the PATH, the OCSP check will be silently ignored. Since version 2.4, cryptography has support for OCSP requests, without the need to have openssl binary available locally.
    
    This PR takes advantage of it, and will use the built-in support of OCSP in cryptography for versions >= 2.4. Otherwise, fallback is done do a direct call to openssl binary, allowing oldest requirements to still work with legacy cryptography versions.
    
    Update: requirement is now cryptography >= 2.5, to avoid to rely on a private method from cryptography.

    acme: add TLSALPN01Response for initiating tls-alpn-01. (#6689)
    
    The existing `acme.TLSALPN01` challenge class did not have
    a `response_cls`, meaning it was not possible to use a tls-alpn-01
    challenge with `client.answer_challenge`.
    
    To support the above a simple `TLSALPN01Response` class is added that
    doesn't provide the ability to solve a tls-alpn-01 challenge end to end
    (e.g. generating and serving the correct response certificate) but that
    does allow the challenge to be initiated. This is sufficient for users
    that have set up the challenge response independent of the `acme`
    module code.
    
    Resolves #6676

    [Windows] Fix account paths on Windows when colons are involved (#6711)
    
    
    The account path used to store user credentials is calculated from the domain used to contact the relevant ACME CA server.
    
    For instance, if the directory URL is https://my.domain.net/directory, then the account path will be $CONFIG_DIR/accounts/my.domain.net.
    
    However, if non standard HTTP/HTTPS port need to be used, colons will be involved. For instance, https://my.domain.net:14000/directory will give $CONFIG_DIR/accounts/my.domain.net:14000.
    
    Colons in paths are supported on POSIX systems, but not on Windows (it is reserved for the root drive letter).
    
    This PR replaces colons by underscores for account paths on Windows, and leaves them untouched on Linux.
    
    * Fix account path on Windows when colons are involved
    
    * Protect colon in drive letter

    Set --pyargs directly in the files where it is needed. (#6727)
    
    It was pointed out to me that you can no longer run tox.cover.py directly to run coverage tests on a subset of the packages in this repo.
    
    This happened after we did both of:
    
    1. Factored out --pyargs from the different test files and put it in pytest.ini.
    2. Moved the options we added to pytest.ini to tox.ini meaning that --pyargs is not set unless you run the file through tox.
    
    I think the fact that we factored out --pyargs from the files that needed it was a mistake. --pytest is needed by tox.cover.py and install_and_test.py in order to work correctly.
    
    I think CLI options like this which are needed for the file to function should be left in the file directly. Doing anything else in my opinion unnecessarily couples these scripts to other files making them more brittle and harder to maintain.
    
    With that said, I also think CLI options which are not needed (such as --numprocesses) can be left to be optionally added through PYTEST_ADDOPTS.
    
    * Add --pyargs to tox.cover.py.
    
    * Add --pyargs to install_and_test.py.
    
    * Remove --pyargs from tox.ini.

    Call atexit handlers before test tearDown to remove errors on Windows (#6667)
    
    When certbot is executing, several resources are opened. It is typically file handles and locks on them. Of course, theses resources need to be cleanup. It is done in Certbot by registering cleanup functions through atexit module, that ensures theses functions will be called when Certbot exit. This allow to not care about resource cleanup everywhere in the code, as it is processed globally.
    
    The problem with atexit is it cleanup functions are called when the Python program exit. If the program is Certbot itself when used, this is Pytest in unit test execution. So during a unit test execution, cleanup is not called after a test and before its tearDown, but when Pytest exit, so way after tests and their respective tearDown.
    
    But many tearDown implies to delete folders where this kind of resources are hold.
    
    This is never a problem on Linux, thanks to its non-blocking file handling. It is usually not a problem on Windows, despite its blocking approach. But if the tearDown requires folder cleanup, exceptions are raised, and currently hidden as warnings. There is currently 504 exceptions of this type in Certbot core tests on Windows.
    
    This PR starts to correct this situation. To do so, some of the functions cleanup normally called through atexit, are explicitly called as part of the tearDown process of relevant test classes, before directory removal is done. Theses situations come all from the certbot.tests.util.TempDirTestCase, so the code is in this specific tearDown process.
    
    As a consequence, exceptions drop from 504 to 64.
    
    Then there are still a significant part of them, that will be handled in later mitigation.
    
    * Call atexit handlers before test tearDown to reduce errors on Windows
    
    * Clear locks dict after global releasing execution
    
    * Remove last tearDown errors.

    AMIs were taken from https://wiki.debian.org/Cloud/AmazonEC2Image/Stretch and https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/.
    
    I didn't update the AMI for Fedora due to #6698.
    
    These new AMIs pass on all test farm tests we run during the release process except Ubuntu 18.04 and 18.10 fail on test_apache2.sh. This is tracked at #6706. If this PR lands before this issue is resolved, we should list these systems as expected failures in the release notes.
    
    Adding these AMIs slows down our tests significantly. I didn't measure it, but it feels 50-100% slower at least on my setup. I think it's worth it though.
    
    * Update test farm targets.
    
    * use different ubuntu ami
    
    * Fix test_leauto_upgrades.sh on newer OSes.

    Update setuptools pinned in pipstrap (#6699) (#6704)
    
    Fixes #6697.
    
    This PR updates the version of setuptools pinned in pipstrap which works around the problems we have seen on recent OSes.
    
    Why did I pick this version of setuptools? Because it's the latest and greatest, [supports all versions of Python that we do](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/v40.6.3/setup.py#L173), [has been out for a month and a half without the need for a point release](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html), and has no non-optional dependencies.
    
    For the last point about dependencies, I don't think we have too much to worry about. setuptools did have a period between versions 34.0.0 and 36.0.0 where they tried to have normal dependencies on other packages, but reverted these changes. See their [changelog for 36.0.0](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/history.html#v36-0-0).
    
    You can also compare their [current setup.py file](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/v40.6.3/setup.py) to the [setup.py file for the currently pinned version](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/v29.0.1/setup.py) and you'll see [not much has changed](https://pastebin.com/nQj6d7D8).
    
    Not only that, but I have successfully tested these changes on:
    
    * ubuntu18.10
    * ubuntu18.04LTS
    * ubuntu16.04LTS
    * ubuntu14.04LTS

    Remove commas in filename (#6692)
    
    This will immediately address the breakage reported in #6682 and tracked at #6685. Pip 19.0.0 and 19.0.1 don't allow commas in filenames, so don't use commas in filenames in certbot-apache test code.
    
    I've confirmed that this fixes the issue on a machine that fails with the version of certbot-auto currently in master: recent version of virtualenv, python 2.7.
    
    Steps to test:
    
    push master to test box
    run tools/venv.py
    activate venv
    pip --version: 19.0.1
    pip install ./certbot-apache/: fails
    push branch code to test box
    confirm pip --version still 19.0.1
    pip install ./certbot-apache/: success
    
    * Rename old,default.conf to old-and-default.conf

    Add VIRTUALENV_NO_DOWNLOAD=1 to all calls to virtualenv (#6690)
    
    This will immediately address the breakage reported in #6682 and tracked at #6685. Virtualenv downloads the latest pip, which causes issues, so tell virtualenv to not download the latest pip.
    
    I added the flag preemptively to other files as well, they're in separate commits so it will be easy to revert any spots we don't want.
    
    I've confirmed that this fixes the issue on a machine that fails with the version of certbot-auto currently in master: recent version of virtualenv, python 2.7.

    Remove commas in filename (#6692)
    
    This will immediately address the breakage reported in #6682 and tracked at #6685. Pip 19.0.0 and 19.0.1 don't allow commas in filenames, so don't use commas in filenames in certbot-apache test code.
    
    I've confirmed that this fixes the issue on a machine that fails with the version of certbot-auto currently in master: recent version of virtualenv, python 2.7.
    
    Steps to test:
    
    push master to test box
    run tools/venv.py
    activate venv
    pip --version: 19.0.1
    pip install ./certbot-apache/: fails
    push branch code to test box
    confirm pip --version still 19.0.1
    pip install ./certbot-apache/: success

    Add VIRTUALENV_NO_DOWNLOAD=1 to all calls to virtualenv (#6690)
    
    This will immediately address the breakage reported in #6682 and tracked at #6685. Virtualenv downloads the latest pip, which causes issues, so tell virtualenv to not download the latest pip.
    
    I added the flag preemptively to other files as well, they're in separate commits so it will be easy to revert any spots we don't want.
    
    I've confirmed that this fixes the issue on a machine that fails with the version of certbot-auto currently in master: recent version of virtualenv, python 2.7.

    Do not ignore editable distributions already installed. (#6675)
    
    This PR fix tests when run with unpinned dependencies. Option --ignore-installed is removed from pip command, allowing to use local dev modules (like acme) that are not still released.
    
    Be warned that these tests will mostly work correctly if the relevant virtualenv in .tox does not exist yet. Otherwise, already installed distribution, potentially not up-to-date, will be reused without update from pip if they match the minimal requirements in relevant projects. This is unlikely to be an issue on CI systems, that will start from a fresh system.
    
    We may build a dedicated tox environment for unpinned dependencies tests purpose, and ensure consistency of these tests on all situations.

    Allow to execute a tox target without pinned dependencies (#6590)
    
    This PR passes the CERTBOT_NO_PIN environment variable to the unit tests tox envs. By setting CERTBOT_NO_PIN to 1 before executing a given tox env, certbot dependencies will be installed at their latest version instead of the usual pinned version.
    
    I also moved the unpin logic one layer below to allow it to be used potentially more widely, and avoid unnecessary merging constraints operation in this case.
    
    As warnings are errors now, latest versions of Python will break now the tests, because collections launch a warning when some classes are imported from collections instead of collections.abc. Certbot code is patched, and warning is ignored for now, because a lot of third party libraries still depend on this behavior.
    
    * Allow to execute a tox target without pinned dependencies
    
    * Correct lint
    
    * Retrigger build.
    
    * Remove debug code
    
    * Added test against unpinned dependencies from test-everything-unpinned-dependencies branch
    
    * Remove duplicated assertion to pass TRAVIS and APPVEYOR in default tox environment.

    Setup cron build with specific jobs (#6661)
    
    Fixes #6659
    
    It appears that the conditional statement if: cron = type works as expected:
    
    on a push event, jobs marked with this statement are completely ignored
    on a cron event, these jobs are executed
    This PR takes advantages of it, by integrating the specific environments from test-everything branch to be merged into master, and add the conditional statement to execute them only during cron builds.
    
    Once this PR is merged, a cron job can be set to build master at the appropriate time of the day, and test-everything will not be needed anymore.
    
    For execution examples from this branch, see:
    
    during a push event: https://travis-ci.org/adferrand/certbot/builds/480127828
    during a cron event: https://travis-ci.org/adferrand/certbot/builds/480130236
    
    * Use the conditional expression in travis.yml to execute jobs from test-everything only during cron executions.

    [Windows|Unix] Avoid to re-execute challenges already validated (#6551)
    
    In response to #5342.
    
    Currently, certbot will execute the operations necessary to validate a challenge even if the challenge has already been validated before against the acme ca server. This can occur for instance if a certificate is asked and issue correctly, then deleted locally, then asked again.
    
    It is a corner case, but it will lead to some heavy operations (like updating a DNS zone, or creating an HTTP server) that are not needed.
    
    This PR corrects this behavior by not executing challenges already validated, and use them directly instead to issue the certificate.
    
    Fixes #5342
    
    * Avoid to execute a given challenge that have been already validated by acme ca server.
    
    * Execute tls challenge on a separate dns name, to avoid reusing the existing valid http challenge.
    
    * Align with master
    
    * Improve log
    
    * Simplify the implementation
    
    * Update changelog
    
    * Add a unit test to ensure that validated challenges are not rerun

    Stop using staging in apacheconftests (#6647)
    
    Fixes #6585.
    
    I wrote up three suggestions for fixing this at https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/6585#issuecomment-448054502. I took the middle approach of requiring the user to provide an ACME server to use. I like this better than the other approaches which were:
    
    > Resolve #5938 instead of this issue.
    
    There is value in these tests as is over the compatibility tests in that they don't use Docker and run on different OSes.
    
    > Spin up a local Python server to return the directory object.
    
    Trying to set up a dummy ACME server seemed hacky and error prone.
    
    Other notes about this PR are:
    
    * I put the Pebble setup in `tox.ini` rather than `.travis.yml` as this seems much cleaner and more natural.
    * I created a new `tox` environment called `apacheconftest-with-pebble` that reuses the code from `testenv:apacheconftest` so `apacheconftest` can continue to be used with servers other than Pebble like is done in our test farm tests.
    * I chose the environment variable `SERVER` for consistency with our integration tests. I chose to not give this environment variable a default but to fail fast when it is not set.
    * I ran test farm tests on this PR and they passed.

    Reduce build log verbosity on Travis (#6597)
    
    PR #6568 removed the --quiet option in pip invocations, because this option deletes a lot of extremely useful logs when something goes wrong. However, when everything goes right, or at least when pip install is correctly executed, theses logs add hundreds of lines that are only noise, making hard to debug errors that can be in only one or two lines.
    
    We can have best of both worlds. Travis allows to fold large blocks of logs, that can be expanded directly from the UI if needed. It only requires to print in the console some specific code, that this PR implements in the pip_install.py script when the build is run in Travis (known by the existence of TRAVIS environment variable).
    
    I also take the occasion to clean up a little tox.ini.
    
    Note that AppVeyor does not have this fold capability, but it can be emulated using a proper capture of stdout/stderr delivered only when an error is detected.
    
    * Fold pip install log on travis
    
    * Global test env
    
    * Export env variable

    Correct the oldest requirements environment (#6569)
    
    I observed that the current set of oldest requirements do not correspond to any environment, except the specific Xenial image in Travis CI (and standard Xenial containers will also fail).
    
    It is because the requirements make cryptography and requests fail against standard libraries available in the typical Linux distributions that are targeted by the oldest requirements approach (Centos 6, Centos 7, Xenial, Jessie).
    
    This PR fixes that, by aligning the minimal version requirements of cryptography and requests to the maximal versions that are available on Centos 6. Centos 7, Jessie and Xenial stay unusable with oldest requirements for other reasons, but at least one old and supported Linux distribution is able to run the tests with oldest requirements out of the box.
    
    A test is also corrected to match the expected error message that old versions of urllib3 will raise.

    Fix oldest nginx integration tests (#6642)
    
    #6636 broke [test-everything tests](https://travis-ci.org/certbot/certbot/builds/475173804) because `_common.sh` is a common file shared between Certbot and Nginx integration tests and `--no-random-sleep-on-renew` isn't defined for the version of Certbot used in the "oldest" integration tests.
    
    This PR adds code to `_common.sh` to check the Certbot version and if it's new enough, add `--no-random-sleep-on-renew` to the command line. I repurposed `$store_flags` and stopped exporting it because it's not used anywhere outside of this file.
    
    Other approaches I considered and decided against were:
    
    1. Adding this flag in `certbot-boulder-integration.sh`. I decided against it because it's setting us up for the same problem in the future if the oldest version of Certbot is upgraded in the Nginx tests and we call `certbot renew`.
    2. Just upgrading the oldest version of Certbot required by Nginx to avoid these issues. While this would work (with perhaps some unnecessary burden for our packagers), I think it's avoiding the real problem here which should now be able to addressed easily with the addition of `$other_flags` and `version_at_least`.
    
    * Add version_at_least().
    
    * Conditionally disable sleep.
    
    * Consolidate store_flags and other_flags.
    
    * update comments

    Add missing acme.jose attribute. (#6637)
    
    Fixes the problem at https://github.com/certbot/certbot/pull/6592#discussion_r245106383.
    
    The tests use `eval` which neither myself or `pylint` like very much. I started to change this by splitting the path we wanted to test and repeatedly calling `getattr`, but it didn't seem worth the effort to me.

    Allow josepy to be accessed through acme.jose. (#6592)
    
    When working on an update to our packages in Ubuntu Xenial, @NCommander noticed that importing code through acme.jose no longer works since josepy became a separate package and remembers having to fix up some code that was using acme.jose himself.
    
    This PR should fix that problem by making all of josepy accessible through acme.jose. This is primarily beneficial to our OS package maintainers who want to avoid subtle API changes when updating packages in stable repositories. They will likely backport this change, but I figure we might as well add it ourselves to minimize divergences in our OS packages in the future and avoid problems on the off chance someone hasn't upgraded acme and was relying on this feature.

    GitHub notified us about a security vulnerability in our pinned version of `urllib3` earlier this week. It doesn't affect us, but we might as well upgrade anyway. I checked:
    
    * There are no backwards incompatible features we care about listed at https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/master/CHANGES.rst.
    * urllib3's dependencies don't also need to be updated according to https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/1.24.1/setup.py.
    * The hashes match when obtained from different network vantage points.

    Remove -q/--quiet from pip invocations. (#6568)
    
    While reducing noise in test output is valuable, this flag has made a couple aspects of Certbot's development difficult:
    
    1. We test with different sets of dependencies and running pip in quiet mode removes all output about the packages being installed which has made reviewing changes to these tests more difficult.
    2. When pip fails, it provides significantly less output about the failure in quiet mode than it does normally. The output is reduced so much that in the two times I've hit this issue in the last month, I was only able to see that installing package X failed rather than what the cause of that failure was which could be seen with `--quiet` removed.
    
    Also, since running pip without `--quiet` is the tox default, I expect Python developers to be familiar with what they see here.

    Don't use pytest.ini during the release. (#6550)
    
    Currently the release script in master fails for a few reasons. First, it's trying to use --numprocesses which comes from a pytest plugin that we're not installing in the release script. Second, many new warnings are raised when we're not using pinned versions of our dependencies.
    
    I'm not sure I agree, but one could argue that we should fix these issues and use the file during the release. I'm particularly hesitant for us to do this when it comes to warnings. We currently do not pin our dependencies in the release script. Do we really want to stop the release because a new package was released and is warning about something? One could argue we do because these warnings may be visible to the user, but they very rarely are and I think this makes the release process much too painful.
    
    I especially do not think we should block the release on this now as we are not up to date on the warnings raised by the latest versions of our packages so there is a lot to work through.
    
    * Don't use pytest.ini during the release.
    
    * State that pytest.ini isn't used in release script.

    Change default privkey permissions while preserving group permissions (#6480)
    
    Fixes #1473.
    
    writes privkey.pem to 0600 by default for new lineages
    on renewals where a new privkey is generated, preserves group mode and gid
    Things this PR does not do:
    
    we talked about forcing 0600 on privkeys when a Certbot upgrade is detected. Instead, this PR only creates new lineages with the more restrictive permission to prevent renewal breakages.
    this doesn't solve many of the problems mentioned in #1473 that are not directly related to the title issue!
    
    * safe_open on archive keyfiles

    Update pinned version of cffi to 1.11.5 (#6512)
    
    Current pinned version of cffi is 1.10.0. This version does not provide pre-compiled wheels for latest Python versions on Windows. This implies on this plateform, when certbot is installed, to compile cffi from sources.
    
    But for that, the computer will need to have the Visual C compiler available locally. This environnement is really heavy to setup, and totally outside of the scope.
    
    This PR updates cffi to version 1.11.5, that has the required wheels, and makes certbot installable without a full .NET dev profile.

    [Windows] Change default paths for Certbot when run on Windows (#6416)
    
    Defaults path of Certbot are the following:
    
    config: /etc/letsencrypt
    workdir: /var/letsencrypt/lib
    logs: /var/letsencrypt/log
    On Windows, this translate into:
    
    config: C:\etc\letsencrypt
    workdir: C:\var\letsencrypt\lib
    logs: C:\var\letsencrypt\log
    As Windows does not follow the standard POSIX filesystem layout, theses paths do not have a lot of sense in this case.
    
    This PR sets the following default paths when Certbot is run on Windows:
    
    config: C:\Certbot
    workdir: C:\Certbot\lib
    logs: C:\Certbot\log
    Better to decide the default paths for Certbot before users start to run it on Windows, to avoid future migration procedures.

    Protect certbot-auto against automated downgrades (#6448)
    
    With current code, the certbot-auto self-upgrade process can make it actually to downgrade itself, because the comparison done is an equality test between local certbot-auto version and the remote one. This is a flaw for attackers, that could make certbot-auto break itself by falsely advertising it about an old version as the latest one available.
    
    A function is added to make a more advanced comparison between version. Certbot-auto will upgrade itself only if the local version is strictly inferior to the latest one available. For instance, a version 0.28.0 will not upgrade itself if the latest one available on internet is 0.27.1. Similarly, non-official versions like 0.28.0.dev0 will never trigger a self-upgrade, to help development workflows.
    
    This implementation relies only on the Python distribution installed by certbot-auto (supporting 2.7+) and basic shell operations, to be compatible with any UNIX-based system.
    
    * Check version with protection again downgrade
    
    * Create a stable version of letsencrypt-auto to use correctly self-upgrade functionality
    
    * Update letsencrypt-auto-source/letsencrypt-auto.template

    Fix up environment variable use in venv creation scripts (#6518)
    
    This PR has the value of VENV_NAME override any value set in the tools/venv* scripts.
    
    I also removed the use of VENV_ARGS. This was used in _venv_common.sh as a means of passing arguments for virtualenv between the scripts, however, there is no other use of the variable in this repository and passing the arguments through a function call is much more natural in Python.
    
    * Respect VENV_NAME in tools/venv*.
    
    * Stop using VENV_ARGS
    
    * Remove VENV_NAME_ENV_VAR and add docstrings.

    Update tools/venv3.py to support py launcher on Windows (#6493)
    
    Following some inconsistencies occurred during by developments, and in the light of #6508, it decided to wrote a PR that will take fully advantage of the conversion from bash to python to the development setup tools.
    
    This PR adresses several issues when trying to use the development setup tools (`tools/venv.py` and `tools/venv3.py`:
    * on Windows, `python` executable is not always in PATH (default behavior)
    * even if the option is checked, the `python` executable is not associated to the usually symlink `python3` on Windows
    * on Windows again, really powerful introspection of the available Python environments can be done with `py`, the Windows Python launcher
    * in general for all systems, `tools/venv.py` and `tools/venv3.py` ensures that the respective Python major version will be used to setup the virtual environment if available.
    * finally, the best and first candidate to test should be the Python executable used to launch the `tools/venv*.py` script. It was not relevant before because it was shell scripts, but do it is.
    
    The logic is shared in `_venv_common.py`, and will be called appropriately for both scripts. In priority decreasing order, python executable will be search and tested:
    * from the current Python executable, as exposed by `sys.executable`
    * from any python or pythonX (X as a python version like 2, 3 or 2.7 or 3.4) executable available in PATH
    * from the Windows Python launched `py` if available
    
    Individual changes were:
    
    * Update tools/venv3.py to support py launcher on Windows
    
    * Fix typo in help message
    
    * More explicit calls with space protection
    
    * Complete refactoring to take advantage of the python runtime, and control of the compatible version to use.

    Fail-fast in test/cover/lint scripts (#6487)
    
    After #6485 and #6435, it appears that there is no good reason to not fail fast when test, cover or linting scripts are executed.
    
    This PR ensures to fail fast by invoking commands throught subprocess.check_call instead of subprocess.call, and by removing the handling of non-zero exit code at the end of theses scripts.
    
    As now coverage on Windows is executed with thresholds, I added specific thresholds for this platform. Because some portions of code that are done for Unix platform will not be executed on Windows.
    
    Note that coverage reports from Travis and AppVeyor are accumulated on Codecov. So if a file is covered up to 50 % on Linux, and all other parts are covered on Windows, then coverage is 100 % for Codecov.
    
    Note: that PR also fixes the ability of coverage tests to fail if thresholds are exceeded.
    
    * Use check_call to fail fast in all scripts related to tests/lint/coverage/deploy
    
    * Make specific coverage threshold for windows

    [URGENT] Fix the CI system (#6485)
    
    It is about the exit codes that are returned from the various scripts in tools during tox execution.
    Indeed, tox relies on the non-zero exit code from a given script to know that something failed during the execution.
    
    Previously, theses scripts were in bash, and a bash script returns an exit code that is the higher code returned from any of the command executed by the script. So if any command return a non-zero (in particular pylint or pytest), then the script return also non-zero.
    
    Now that these scripts are converted into python, pylint and pytest are executed via subprocess, that returns the exit code as variables. But if theses codes are not handled explicitly, the python script itself will return zero if no python exception occured. As a consequence currently, Certbot CI system is unable to detect any test error or lint error, because there is no exception in this case, only exit codes from the binaries executed.
    
    This PR fixes that, by handling correctly the exit code from the most critical scripts, install_and_test.py and tox.cover.py, but also all the scripts that I converted into Python and that could be executed in the context of a shell (via tox or directly for instance).

    [Windows|Unix] Rewrite bash scripts for tests into python (#6435)
    
    Certbot relies heavily on bash scripts to deploy a development environment and to execute tests. This is fine for Linux systems, including Travis, but problematic for Windows machines.
    
    This PR converts all theses scripts into Python, to make them platform independant.
    
    As a consequence, tox-win.ini is not needed anymore, and tox can be run indifferently on Windows or on Linux using a common tox.ini. AppVeyor is updated accordingly to execute tests for acme, certbot and all dns plugins. Other tests are not executed as they are for Docker, unsupported Apache/Nginx/Postfix plugins (for now) or not relevant for Windows (explicit Linux distribution tests or pylint).
    
    Another PR will be done on certbot website to update how a dev environment can be set up.

    [Windows] Handle file renaming when the destination path already exists (#6415)
    
    On Linux, you can invoke os.rename(src, dst) even if dst already exists. In this case, destination file will be atomically replaced by the source file.
    
    On Windows, this will lead to an OSError because changes are not atomic. This cause certbot renew to fail in particular, because the old certificate configuration needs to be replace by the new when a certificate is effectively renewed.
    
    One could use the cross-platform function os.replace, but it is available only on Python >= 3.3.
    
    This PR add a function in compat to handle correctly this case on Windows, and delegating everything else to os.rename.
    
    * Cross platform compatible os.rename (we can use os.replace if its python 3)
    
    * Use os.replace instead of custom non-atomic code.
    
    * Avoid errors for lint and mypy. Add a test.

    Use the ACMEv2 newNonce endpoint when a new nonce is needed (#6442)
    
    Also, add checking to the newNonce HEAD request, and check responses in general before attempting to save a nonce, for a better error message.
    
    * check response before adding nonce to the pool
    
    * fix tests so that they test what they're supposed to test, and also allow the order of _add_nonce and _check_response to be switched
    
    * make _get_nonce take acme_version
    
    * Send HEAD to newNonce endpoint when using ACMEv2
    
    * check the HEAD newNonce response
    
    * remove unnecessary try; get returns None if the item doesn't exist
    
    * instead of setting new_nonce_url on ClientNetwork, use the saved directory in ClientBase and pass that into ClientNetwork.post
    
    * no need to test acme_version in _get_nonce
    
    * pop new_nonce_url out of kwargs before passing to _send_request

    Dummy AWS credentials for Route53 tests to prevent outbound connections (#6456)
    
    Boto3 / botocore library has a feature that tries to fetch AWS credentials from IAM if a set of credentials isn't available otherwise. This happens when boto loops through different credential providers in order to find the keys. See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=912103
    
    This PR simply adds dummy environmental variables for the tests that will be picked up by the credential provider iterator in order to prevent making outbound connections.
    
    * Hardcode dummy AWS credentials to prevent boto3 making outgoing connections
    
    * Remove the dummy credentials when tearing down test case

commit 1e8c13ebf905d1972e3c3c2474650520df1be921
Author: Adrien Ferrand <adferrand@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   2018-10-19 23:53:15 +0200

    [Windows] Create the CI logic (#6374)
    
    So here we are: after #6361 has been merged, time is to provide an environment to execute the automated testing on Windows.
    
    Here are the assertions used to build the CI on Windows:
    
    every test running on Linux should ultimately be runnable on Windows, in a cross-platform compatible manner (there is one or two exception, when a test does not have any meaning for Windows),
    currently some tests are not runnable on Windows: theses tests are ignored by default when the environment is Windows using a custom decorator: @broken_on_windows,
    test environment should have functionalities similar to Travis, in particular an execution test matrix against various versions of Python and Windows,
    so test execution is done through AppVeyor, as it supports the requirements: it add a CI step along Travis and Codecov for each PR, all of this ensuring that Certbot is entirely functional on both Linux and Windows,
    code in tests can be changed, but code in Certbot should be changed as little as possible, to avoid regression risks.
    So far in this PR, I focused on the tests on Certbot core and ACME library. Concerning the plugins, it will be done later, for plugins which have an interest on Windows. Test are executed against Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7, for Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016.
    
    I succeeded at making 258/259 of acme tests to work, and 828/868 of certbot core tests to work. Most of the errors where not because of Certbot itself, but because of how the tests are written. After redesigning some test utilitaries, and things like file path handling, or CRLF/LF, a lot of the errors vanished.
    
    I needed also to ignore a lot of IO errors typically occurring when a tearDown test process tries to delete a file before it has been closed: this kind of behavior is acceptable for Linux, but not for Windows. As a consequence, and until the tearDown process is improved, a lot of temporary files are not cleared on Windows after a test campaign.
    
    Remaining broken tests requires a more subtile approach to solve the errors, I will correct them progressively in future PR.
    
    Last words about tox. I did not used the existing tox.ini for now. It is just to far from what is supported on Windows: lot of bash scripts that should be rewritten completely, and that contain test logic not ready/relevant for Windows (plugin tests, Docker compilation/test, GNU distribution versatility handling and so on). So I use an independent file tox-win.ini for now, with the goal to merge it ultimately with the existing logic.
    
    * Define a tox configuration for windows, to execute tests against Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 + code coverage on Codecov.io
    
    * Correct windows compatibility on certbot codebase
    
    * Correct windows compatibility on certbot display functionalities
    
    * Correct windows compatibility on certbot plugins
    
    * Correct test utils to run tests on windows. Add decorator to skip (permanently) or mark broken (temporarily) tests on windows
    
    * Correct tests on certbot core to run them both on windows and linux. Mark some of them as broken on windows for now.
    
    * Lock tests are completely skipped on windows. Planned to be replace in next PR.
    
    * Correct tests on certbot display to run them both on windows and linux. Mark some of them as broken on windows for now.
    
    * Correct test utils for acme on windows. Add decorator to skip (permanently) or mark broken (temporarily) tests on windows.
    
    * Correct acme tests to run them both on windows and linux. Allow a reduction of code coverage of 1% on acme code base.
    
    * Create AppVeyor CI for Certbot on Windows, to run the test matrix (py34,35,36,37+coverage) on Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016.
    
    * Update changelog with Windows compatibility of Certbot.
    
    * Corrections about tox, pyreadline and CI logic
    
    * Correct english
    
    * Some corrections for acme
    
    * Newlines corrections
    
    * Remove changelog
    
    * Use os.devnull instead of /dev/null to be used on Windows
    
    * Uid is a always a number now.
    
    * Correct linting
    
    * PR https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/2136 has been merge to third-party upstream 6 months ago, so code patch can be removed.
    
    * And so acme coverage should be 100% again.
    
    * More compatible tests Windows+Linux
    
    * Use stable line separator
    
    * Remove unused import
    
    * Do not rely on pytest in certbot tests
    
    * Use json.dumps to another json embedding weird characters
    
    * Change comment
    
    * Add import
    
    * Test rolling builds #1
    
    * Test rolling builds #2
    
    * Correction on json serialization
    
    * It seems that rolling builds are not canceling jobs on PR. Revert back to fail fast code in the pipeline.

    certbot_dns_linode: increase the default propagation interval (#6320)
    
    Using the default value of 16 minutes (960 seconds) for
    --dns-linode-propagation-seconds leads to DNS failures when the randomly
    selected Linode DNS is not the first one out of six, due to an additional
    delay before the other five are updated.
    
    The problem can be easily solved by increasing the wait interval, so
    this commit increases the default value to 20 minutes.

    Update parser to match new Nginx functionality (#6381)
    
    Previously, Nginx did not allow `${` to start a variable name. Now it's allowed to. This means we'll be more permissible than Nginx when people are on older versions of Nginx, but it's unlikely anyone was relying on this to fail in the first place, so that's probably ok.

    This makes errors more useful when Nginx can't be found or when Nginx's
    configuration can't be found.  Previously, a generic
    `NoInstallationError` isn't descriptive enough to explain _what_ wasn't
    installed or what failed without going digging into the source code.

    Make Certbot runnable on Windows (#6296)
    
    * Add and use a compatibility layer to allow certbot to be run on windows.
    
    * Fix path comparison
    
    * Corrections on compat and util for tests
    
    * Less intrusive way to parse prefix in webroot plugin working for both linux and windows.
    
    * Disable pylint import-error for some optional imports in compat.py
    
    * Ensure path is normalized before prefixes are generated in webroot plugin
    
    * Same prefixes in linux and windows, in fact root path is not needed in webroot plugin
    
    * Check that user has administrative rights before continuing on windows (necessary for symlink creation)
    
    * More straightforward way to test administrative rights on windows
    
    * Try to resolve import error in travis ci

    Fix Sphinx (#6070)
    
    Fixes #4686.
    
    In Sphinx 1.6, they changed how they handle images in latex and PDF files. You can learn more about this by reading the linked issue (or I can answer any questions), but the shortish version is we now need to use the extension sphinx.ext.imgconverter. This is only available in Sphinx 1.6+.
    
    I also updated our pinned versions to use the latest Sphinx and a new dependency it pulled in called sphinxcontrib-websupport. To build the latex and PDF docs, you must first run:
    
    apt-get install imagemagick latexmk texlive texlive-latex-extra
    
    Afterwards, if you create the normal Certbot dev environment using this branch, activate the virtual environment, and from the root of the repo run make -C docs clean latex latexpdf, you'll successfully build the PDF docs.
    
    * fix #4686
    
    * bump minimum Sphinx req

    Make Apache control script and binary paths configurable on command line (#6238)
    
    This PR adds two new command line parameters, --apache-ctlpath and --apache-binpath both of which are used to construct commands that we shell out for.
    
    The way that we previously fetched values either from Certbot configuration object or the dictionary of distribution based constants is now also unified, and the active options are parsed in prepare() to make it easier to override needed values for the distributions needing this behavior.
    
    Fixes: #5338
    
    * Added the command line options and parsing
    
    * Refactor existing code
    
    * Distro override updates
    
    * Handle vhost_root from cli
    
    * Fix compatibility tests
    
    * Add comment about changes to command line arguments
    
    * Check None properly
    
    * Made help texts consistent
    
    * Keep the old defaults
    
    * Move to shorter CLI parameter names
    
    * No need for specific bin path, nor apache_cmd anymore
    
    * Make sure that we use user provided vhost-root value
    
    * Fix alt restart commands in overrides
    
    * Fix version_cmd defaults in overrides
    
    * Fix comparison
    
    * Remove cruft, and use configuration object for parser parameter

    Enable Apache VirtualHost for HTTP challenge validation if not enabled already (#6268)
    
    If user provides a custom --apache-vhost-root path that's not parsed by Apache per default, Certbot fails the challenge validation. While the VirtualHost on custom path is correctly found, and edited, it's still not seen by Apache. This PR adds a temporary Include directive to the root Apache configuration when writing the challenge tokens to the VirtualHost.

    Handle existing ACMEv1 and ACMEv2 accounts (#6214) (#6215)
    
    Fixes #6207.
    
    As noted by Erica:
    
    - we no longer need to check if it exists before linking to it, because we delete properly.
    - the previously excisting check on if server is in `LE_REUSE_SERVERS` before unlinking is nice, but probably not necessary, especially since we don't officially support people doing weird things with symlinks in our directories, and because we rmdir which will fail if it's not empty anyway.
    
    * Create single account symlink.
    
    * refactor _delete_accounts_dir_for_server_path
    
    * add symlinked account dir deletion
    
    * add tests

    OVH DNS Authenticator (#5423)
    
    Implement an Authenticator which can fulfill a dns-01 challenge using the OVH DNS API. Applicable only for domains using OVH DNS.
    
    Testing Done:
     * `tox -e py27`
     * `tox -e lint`
     * Manual testing:
        * Used `certbot certonly --dns-ovh -d`, specifying a credentials file as a command line argument. Verified that a certificate was successfully obtained without user interaction.
        * Used `certbot certonly --dns-ovh -d`, without specifying a credentials file as a command line argument. Verified that the user was prompted and that a certificate was successfully obtained.
        * Used `certbot certonly -d`. Verified that the user was prompted for a credentials file after selecting dnsimple interactively and that a certificate was successfully obtained.
        * Used `certbot renew --force-renewal`. Verified that certificates
          were renewed without user interaction.
     * Negative testing:
        * Path to non-existent credentials file.
        * Credentials file with unsafe permissions (644).
        * Path to credentials file with an invalid application key.
        * Path to credentials file with an invalid application secret.
        * Path to credentials file with an invalid consumer key.
        * Path to credentials file with missing properties.

    Upgrade pinned josepy version (#6184)
    
    We released josepy 1.1.0 a while ago to work around newer versions of cryptography deprecating some of the functionality we were using. We haven't yet upgraded our pinned josepy version though and since #6169 has landed, we're now seeing these deprecation warnings in our tests. This would be shown to certbot-auto users as well.
    
    This PR removes these warnings by upgrading our pinned version of josepy.
    
    * update pinned josepy version
    
    * build leauto

    Do not call IPlugin.prepare() for updaters when running renew (#6167)
    
    interfaces.GenericUpdater and new enhancement interface updater functions get run on every invocation of Certbot with "renew" verb for every lineage. This causes performance problems for users with large configurations, because of plugin plumbing and preparsing happening in prepare() method of installer plugins. This PR moves the responsibility to call prepare() to the plugin (possibly) implementing a new style enhancement interface.
    
    Fixes: #6153
    
    * Do not call IPlugin.prepare() for updaters when running renew
    
    * Check prepare called in tests
    
    * Refine pydoc and make the function name more informative
    
    * Verify the plugin type

    * We don't need to run dpkg -s in before_install.
    
    * Remove augeas sources.
    
    We only needed it for Ubuntu Precise which is dead and it doesn't work in Ubuntu Xenial.

    Let's continue the approach of testing on the oldest and newest versions of Python 3. We will continue testing on Python 3.6 in the nightly tests.

    Remove .dev0 from version numbers during releases. (#6116)
    
    This allows us to depend on packages like acme>=0.26.0.dev0 during development
    and automatically change it to acme>=0.26.0 during the release. We use `git add
    -p` to be safe, but if .dev0 is used at all in our released setup.py files,
    we're probably doing something wrong.

    docs: move warning about distro provided renewal (#6133)
    
    Currently, you must read ten paragraphs about writing renewal hooks
    before you find that most distributions will automatically renew certs
    for you.  This is burying the lede in a major way; moving it up to the
    header seems a better choice.

    Gradually increasing HSTS max-age (#5912)
    
    This PR adds the functionality to enhance Apache configuration to include HTTP Strict Transport Security header with a low initial max-age value.
    
    The max-age value will get increased on every (scheduled) run of certbot renew regardless of the certificate actually getting renewed, if the last increase took place longer than ten hours ago. The increase steps are visible in constants.AUTOHSTS_STEPS.
    
    Upon the first actual renewal after reaching the maximum increase step, the max-age value will be made "permanent" and will get value of one year.
    
    To achieve accurate VirtualHost discovery on subsequent runs, a comment with unique id string will be added to each enhanced VirtualHost.
    
    * AutoHSTS code rebased on master
    
    * Fixes to match the changes in master
    
    * Make linter happy with metaclass registration
    
    * Address small review comments
    
    * Use new enhancement interfaces
    
    * New style enhancement changes
    
    * Do not allow --hsts and --auto-hsts simultaneuously
    
    * MyPy annotation fixes and added test
    
    * Change oldest requrements to point to local certbot core version
    
    * Enable new style enhancements for run and install verbs
    
    * Test refactor
    
    * New test class for main.install tests
    
    * Move a test to a correct test class

    Unrevert #6000 and silence deprecation warnings (#6082)
    
    * Revert "Revert "switch signature verification to use pure cryptography (#6000)" (#6074)"
    
    This reverts commit 3cffe1449c4e9166b65eaed75022d73b7ad79328.
    
    * Fixes #6073.
    
    This silences the deprecation warnings from cryptography. I looked into only
    silencing the cryptography warning specifically in the function, however,
    CryptographyDeprecationWarning doesn't seem to be publicly documented, so we
    probably shouldn't depend on it.

    Upgrade pinned twine version. (#6078)
    
    For the past couple of releases, twine has errored while trying to upload
    packages and this is fixed by upgrading to a newer version of twine. This
    commit updates our pinned version installed when using tools/venv.sh to the
    latest available version. pkginfo had to be upgraded as well to support the
    latest version of twine.

    Change GenericUpdater parameter to lineage (#6030)
    
    In order to give more flexibility for plugins using interfaces.GenericUpdater interface, lineage needs to be passed to the updater method instead of individual domains. All of the (present and potential) installers do not work on per domain basis, while the lineage does contain a list of them for installers which do.
    
    This also means that we don't unnecessarily run the updater method multiple times, potentially invoking expensive tooling up to $max_san_amount times.
    
    * Make GenericUpdater use lineage as parameter and get invoked only once per lineage

    cd before running tests (#6017)
    
    When importing a module, Python first searches the current directory. See
    https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path. This
    means that running something like `import certbot` from the root of the Certbot
    repo will use the local Certbot files regardless of the version installed on
    the system or virtual environment.
    
    Normally this behavior is fine because the local files are what we want to
    test, however, during our "oldest" tests, we test against older versions of our
    packages to make sure we're keeping compatibility. To make sure our tests use
    the correct versions, this commit has our tests cd to an empty temporary
    directory before running tests.
    
    We also had to change the package names given to pytest to be the names used in
    Python to import the package rather than the name of the files locally to
    accommodate this.

    Fix noisy tests (#6004)
    
    * Fixes #5570.
    
    The issue is calls to atexit aren't mocked out. During the tests there are many
    repeated calls registering functions to be called when the process exits so
    when the tests finishes, it prints a ton of output from running those
    registered functions. This suppresses that by mocking out atexit.
    
    * Mock at a lower level.
    
    This ensures we don't mess with any other mocks in this test class by mocking
    at the lowest level we can. Other tests shouldn't be mocking out specific
    internals of functions in other modules, so this should work just fine.

    Fix crash when email submission endpoint unavailable (#6002)
    
    * Fix crash when email submission endpoint unavailable
    
    Handle KeyError and ValueError so that if the email submission endpoint
    goes down, Certbot can still run.
    
    Add tests to eff_test.py:
     - simulate non-JSON response as described in issue #5858
     - simulate JSON response without 'status' element
    
    Non-JSON response throws an uncaught ValueError when attempting to
    decode as JSON. A JSON response missing the 'status' element throws an
    uncaught KeyError when checking whether status is True or False.
    
    Teach _check_response to handle ValueError and KeyError and report an
    issue to the user.
    
    Rewrite if statement as assertion with try-except block to make error
    handling consistent within the function. Update test_not_ok to make
    mocked raise_for_status function raise a requests.exceptions.HTTPError.
    
    Resolves #5858
    
    * Update PR with requested changes
    
    - Use `if` instead of `assert` to check `status` element of response JSON
    - Handle KeyError and ValueError in the same way
    - Import requests at the beginning of eff_test.py
    - Clear JSON in test case in a more idiomatic way

    Display (None) instead of a bullet for empty lists (#5999)
    
    Include a line break before "(None)" to maintain consistency with output
    for lists that are not empty.
    
    Previous result as expected for non-empty lists:
    
        >>> _format_list('+', ['one', 'two', 'three'])
        '\n+ one\n+ two\n+ three'
    
    Previous unexpected result for empty lists:
    
        >>> _format_list('+', [])
        '\n+ '
    
    New result as expected (unchanged) for non-empty lists:
    
        >>> _format_list('+', ['one', 'two', 'three'])
        '\n+ one\n+ two\n+ three'
    
    New behavior more explicit for empty lists:
    
        >>> _format_list('+', [])
        '\n(None)'

    Small dev docs improvements (#5953)
    
    * Clarify UNIX only
    
    * Have people develop natively.
    
    Some systems like Arch Linux and macOS require --debug in order to install
    dependencies.
    
    Our bootstrapping script for macOS works, so let's let people who want to
    develop natively.
    
    * briefly mention docker as dev option
    
    * remove bad _common.sh info
    
    * update OS dep section
    
    * Remove sudo from certbot-auto usage
    
    When sudo isn't available, Certbot is able to fall back to su. Removing it from
    the instructions here allows the command to work when its run in minimal
    systems like Docker where sudo may not be installed.
    
    * copy advice about missing interpreters
    
    * Improve integration tests docs
    
    Explain what a boulder is and tell people they probably should just let the
    tests run in Travis.
    
    * Don't tell people to run integration tests.
    
    I don't think any paid Certbot devs run integration tests locally and instead
    rely on Travis. Let's not make others do it.
    
    * fix spacing
    
    * you wouldn't download a CA
    
    * address review comments

    Check_untyped_defs in mypy with clean output for acme (#5874)
    
    * check_untyped_defs in mypy with clean output for acme
    
    * test entire acme module
    
    * Add typing as a dependency because it's only in the stdlib for 3.5+
    
    * Add str_utils, modified for python2.7 compatibility
    
    * make mypy happy in acme
    
    * typing is needed in prod
    
    * we actually only need typing in acme so far
    
    * add tests and more docs for str_utils
    
    * pragma no cover
    
    * add magic_typing
    
    * s/from typing/from magic_typing/g
    
    * move typing to dev_extras
    
    * correctly set up imports
    
    * remove str_utils
    
    * only type: ignore for OpenSSL.SSL, not crypto
    
    * Since we only run mypy with python3 anyway and we're fine importing it when it's not actually there, there's no actual need for typing to be present as a dependency
    
    * comment magic_typing.py
    
    * disable wildcard-import im magic_typing
    
    * disable pylint errors
    
    * add magic_typing_test
    
    * make magic_typing tests work alongside other tests
    
    * make sure temp_typing is set
    
    * add typing as a dev dependency for python3.4
    
    * run mypy with python3.4 on travis to get a little more testing with different environments
    
    * don't stick typing into sys.modules
    
    * reorder imports

    Remove EOL'd Ubuntu from targets.yaml (#5887)
    
    See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases.
    
    Ubuntu 15.* repositories have been shut down for months now causing our tests
    to always fail on these systems. While the tests on Ubuntu 12.04 still work, it
    has been unsupported by Canonical for almost a year and I don't think we should
    hamstring ourselves trying to continue to support it ourselves.

    Don't install enum34 when using Python 3.4 or later. Fix #5456. (#5846)
    
    The re stdlib module requires attrs that don't exist in the backported 3.4 version.
    
    Technically, we are changing our install behavior beyond what is necessary. Previously, enum34 was used for 3.4 and 3.5 as well, and it happened not to conflict, but I think it's better to use the latest bug-fixed stdlib versions as long as they meet the needs of `cryptography`, which is what depends on enum34. That way, at least the various stdlib modules are guaranteed not to conflict with each other.

    PluginStorage to store variables between invocations. (#5468)
    
    The base class for Installer plugins `certbot.plugins.common.Installer` now provides functionality of `PluginStorage` to all installer plugins. This allows a plugin to save and retrieve variables in between of invocations.
    
    The on disk storage is basically a JSON file at `config_dir`/`.pluginstorage.json`, usually `/etc/letsencrypt/.pluginstorage.json`. The JSON structure is automatically namespaced using the internal plugin name as a namespace key. Because the actual storage is JSON, the supported data types are: dict, list, tuple, str, unicode, int, long, float, boolean and nonetype.
    
    To add a variable from inside the plugin class:
    `self.storage.put("my_variable_name", my_var)`
    
    To fetch a variable from inside the plugin class:
    `my_var = self.storage.fetch("my_variable_key")`
    
    The storage state isn't written on disk automatically, but needs to be called:
    `self.storage.save()`
    
    * Plugin storage implementation
    
    * Added config_dir to existing test mocks
    
    * PluginStorage test cases
    
    * Saner handling of bad config_dir paths
    
    * Storage moved to Installer and not initialized on plugin __init__
    
    * Finetuning and renaming

    Break lockstep between our packages (#5655)
    
    Fixes #5490.
    
    There's a lot of possibilities discussed in #5490, but I'll try and explain what I actually did here as succinctly as I can. Unfortunately, there's a fair bit to explain. My goal was to break lockstep and give us tests to ensure the minimum specified versions are correct without taking the time now to refactor our whole test setup.
    
    To handle specifying each package's minimum acme/certbot version, I added a requirements file to each package. This won't actually be included in the shipped package (because it's not in the MANIFEST).
    
    After creating these files and modifying tools/pip_install.sh to use them, I created a separate tox env for most packages (I kept the DNS plugins together for convenience). The reason this is necessary is because we currently use a single environment for each plugin, but if we used this approach for these tests we'd hit issues due to different installed plugins requiring different versions of acme/certbot. There's a lot more discussion about this in #5490 if you're interested in this piece. I unfortunately wasted a lot of time trying to remove the boilerplate this approach causes in tox.ini, but to do this I think we need negations described at complex factor conditions which hasn't made it into a tox release yet.
    
    The biggest missing piece here is how to make sure the oldest versions that are currently pinned to master get updated. Currently, they'll stay pinned that way without manual intervention and won't be properly testing the oldest version. I think we should solve this during the larger test/repo refactoring after the release because the tests are using the correct values now and I don't see a simple way around the problem.
    
    Once this lands, I'm planning on updating the test-everything tests to do integration tests with the "oldest" versions here.
    
    * break lockstep between packages
    
    * Use per package requirements files
    
    * add local oldest requirements files
    
    * update tox.ini
    
    * work with dev0 versions
    
    * Install requirements in separate step.
    
    * don't error when we don't have requirements

    * Update .travis.yml
    
    * Add reminder comments

    Apache plugin wildcard support for ACMEv2 (#5608)
    
    In `deploy_cert()` and `enhance()`, the user will be presented with a dialog to choose from the VirtualHosts that can be covered by the wildcard domain name. The (multiple) selection result will then be handled in a similar way that we previously handled a single VirtualHost that was returned by the `_find_best_vhost()`.
    
    Additionally the selected VirtualHosts are added to a dictionary that maps selections to a wildcard domain to be reused in the later `enhance()` call and not forcing the user to select the same VirtualHosts again.
    
    * Apache plugin wildcard support
    
    * Present dialog only once per domain, added tests
    
    * Raise exception if no VHosts selected for wildcard domain

    ACMEv2: Add Order support
    
    This adds two new classes in messages: Order and OrderResource. It also adds methods to ClientV2 to create orders, and poll orders then request issuance.
    
    The CSR is stored on the OrderResource so it can be carried along and submitted when it's time to finalize the order.

    runs certbot-auto once to try out the latest version (0.21.1), they will
    start getting this message via email every 12 hours.

    - Dev / test cycles are one use case for the "running a local copy of

     another
     - So edit the docs to once again explain how to just run bleeding edge
     Certbot, without (say) always getting staging certs.

    This produces a super-long log line that wraps to 30-60 lines, depending on

    Work around Basic Authentication for challenge dir in Apache (#5461)
    
    Unfortunately, the way that Apache merges the configuration directives is different for mod_rewrite and <Location> / <Directory> directives.
    
    To work around basic auth in VirtualHosts, the challenge override Include had to be split in two. The first part handles overrides for RewriteRule and the other part will handle overrides for <Directory> and <Location> directives.

    Nginx reversion (#5299)
    
    The reason for this PR is many bug fixes in the nginx plugin for changes we haven't released yet are included in #5220 which may not make our next release. If it doesn't, we will (mostly) revert the nginx plugin back to its previous state to avoid releasing these bugs and will revert this PR after the release.
    
    * Revert "Nginx IPv6 support (#5178)"
    
    This reverts commit 68e37b03c821560e7f316d260f8da97ef3e2087c.
    
    * Revert "Fix bug that stopped nginx from finding new server block for redirect (#5198)"
    
    This reverts commit e2ab940ac03ffe4f2cf7c478a1597c0b52f14bc4.
    
    * Revert "Nginx creates a vhost block if no matching block is found (#5153)"
    
    This reverts commit 95a7d4585619d612ff28ac24dac4faefaee59e72.

Author: Jacob Hoffman-Andrews <github@hoffman-andrews.com>
Date:   2017-11-22 13:00:29 -0800

    In ACMEv2, challenges have "url" instead of "uri". To handle this smoothly, Challenge's uri field becomes private (_uri), and is joined by _url. Serialization and deserialization will preserve whichever one was set. The uri name is taken over by an @property that returns whichever of the two is set. I chose not to enforce that they shouldn't both be present because it would just add unnecessary code and brittleness with no stability benefit.
    
    * Make url a virtual field.
    
    * Add @property annotation.

    Distribution specific override functionality based on class inheritance (#5202)
    
    Class inheritance based approach to distro specific overrides.
    
    How it works:
    The certbot-apache plugin entrypoint has been changed to entrypoint.ENTRYPOINT which is a variable containing appropriate override class for system, if available.
    
    Override classes register themselves using decorator override.register() which takes a list of distribution fingerprints (ID & LIKE variables in /etc/os-release, or platform.linux_distribution() as a fallback). These end up as keys in dict override.OVERRIDE_CLASSES and values for the keys are references to the class that called the decorator, hence allowing self-registration of override classes when they are imported. The only file importing these override classes is entrypoint.py, so adding new override classes would need only one import in addition to the actual override class file.
    
    Generic changes:
    
        Parser initialization has been moved to separate class method, allowing easy override where needed.
        Cleaned up configurator.py a bit, and moved some helper functions to newly created apache_util.py
        Split Debian specific code from configurator.py to debian_override.py
        Changed define_cmd to apache_cmd because the parameters are for every distribution supporting this behavior, and we're able to use the value to build the additional configuration dump commands.
        Moved add_parser_mod() from configurator to parser add_mod()
        Added two new configuration dump parsing methods to update_runtime_variables() in parser: update_includes() and update_modules().
        Changed init_modules() in parser to accommodate the changes above. (ie. don't throw existing self.modules out).
        Moved OS based constants to their respective override classes.
        Refactored configurator class discovery in tests to help easier test case creation using distribution based override configurator class.
        tests.util.get_apache_configurator() now takes keyword argument os_info which is string of the desired mock OS fingerprint response that's used for picking the right override class.
    
    This PR includes two major generic additions that should vastly improve our parsing accuracy and quality:
    
        Includes are parsed from config dump from httpd binary. This is mandatory for some distributions (Like OpenSUSE) to get visibility over the whole configuration tree because of Include statements passed on in command line, and not via root httpd.conf file.
        Modules are parsed from config dump from httpd binary. This lets us jump into correct IfModule directives if for some reason we have missed the module availability (because of one being included on command line or such).
    
    Distribution specific changes
    Because of the generic changes, there are two distributions (or distribution families) that do not provide such functionality, so it had to be overridden in their respective override files. These distributions are:
    
        CentOS, because it deliberately limits httpd binary stdout using SELinux as a feature. We are doing opportunistic config dumps here however, in case SELinux enforcing is off.
        Gentoo, because it does not provide a way to invoke httpd with command line parsed from its specific configuration file. Gentoo relies heavily on Define statements that are passed over from APACHE2_OPTS variable /etc/conf.d/apache2 file and most of the configuration in root Apache configuration are dependent on these values.
    
    Debian
    
        Moved the Debian specific parts from configurator.py to Debian specific override.
    
    CentOS
    
        Parsing of /etc/sysconfig/httpd file for additional Define statements. This could hold other parameters too, but parsing everything off it would require a full Apache lexer. For CLI parameters, I think Defines are the most common ones. This is done in addition of opportunistic parsing of httpd binary config dump.
        Added CentOS default Apache configuration tree for realistic test cases.
    
    Gentoo
    
        Parsing Defines from /etc/conf.d/apache2 variable APACHE2_OPTS, which holds additional Define statements to enable certain functionalities, enabling parts of the configuration in the Apache2 DOM. This is done instead of trying to parse httpd binary configuration dumps.
        Added default Apache configuration from Gentoo to testdata, including /etc/conf.d/apache2 file for realistic test cases.

    Quiet pip install output. (#5288)
    
    pip install generates a lot of lines of output that make it harder to see what
    tox is running in general. This adds the -q flag to pip install.
    
    At the same time, add `set -x` in install_and_test.sh and pip_install.sh so they
    echo the commands they are running. This makes it a little clearer what's going
    on in tests.
    
    I didn't put `set -x` at the top or in the shebang, because moving it lower lets
    us avoid echoing some of the messy if/then setup statements in these scripts,
    which focussed attention on the pip install command.

    Remove all but one BOULDER_INTEGRATION, and macOS (#5270)
    
    These tests are retained in the test-everything branch, which has a Travis cron
    job to run nightly.
    
    Removing these speeds up the Certbot Travis builds dramatically for two reasons:
     - The Boulder integration tests are slow (10-12 minutes), and it's exceedingly
       rare for them to fail on one Python environment but not another.
     - The macOS tests take a very long time to run, because they need to wait for
       build slots on the limited number of macOS instances, which are often in high
       demand.

    Extracts the relevant fields using a regex. We considered catching
    specific exception types, and referencing their fields, but the types
    raised by `requests` are not well documented and may not be long
    term stable. If the regex fails to match, for instance due to a change
    in the exception message, the new exception message will just be
    passed through.

    Retry failures to start boulder (#5176)
    
    Occasionally a network error prevents Docker from starting boulder causing
    Travis tests to fail like it did at
    https://travis-ci.org/certbot/certbot/jobs/282923098. This works around the
    problem by using travis_retry to try to start boulder again if it fails.
    
    This also moves the logic of waiting for boulder to start into
    tests/boulder-fetch.sh so people running integration tests locally can benefit.

    Delete after revoke [#4109] (#4914)
    
    *     Switching from old branch (issue-4109) and addressing changes requested
        in last iteration of review:
        https://github.com/certbot/certbot/pull/4202/files/80aa857fd21d7a6be8e7334777dac19456261b02
    
        Requested changes that were addressed:
        - fixed outdated docstring for `cert_path_to_lineage`
        - removed `full_archive_dir_from_renewal_conf` amd replaced with `full_archive_path` (and `_full_archive_path` -> `full_archive_path`)
        - matching on `cert` instead of `chain` in `cert_manager.cert_path_to_lineage`
        - fixed the two coding wrongs make a right issue
    
        Requested changes which were not addressed:
        - moving `cert_path_to_lineage` from `cert_manager` to `storage`,
          as it would introduce a hard to resolve circular dependency.
    
    * Update integration tests to handle default deletion after revoke.
    
    * Swapping test domains.
    
    * Addressing PR feedback:
            - calling storage.full_archive_path with a ConfigObj instead of None
            - Removing lambda x: x.chain_path as an option to match against
    
    * Addressing PR feedback: it's expected that len(pattern) is 0, so handle that case properly.
    
    * Testing of conflicting values of --cert-name and --cert-path non-interactive mode.
    
    * Silly test for when neither certname nor cert-path were specified.
    
    * Changing archive_files to a private function, because mocking nested functions seems impossible.

    Up until now, this test was written incorrectly. In addition, when it has

    Do not parse disabled configuration files from under sites-available on Debian / Ubuntu (#4104)
    
    This changes the apache plugin behaviour to only parse enabled configuration files and respecting the --apache-vhost-root CLI parameter for new SSL vhost creation. If --apache-vhost-root isn't defined, or doesn't exist, the SSL vhost will be created to originating non-SSL vhost directory.
    
    This PR also implements actual check for vhost enabled state, and makes sure parser.parse_file() does not discard changes in Augeas DOM, by doing an autosave.
    
    Also handles enabling the new SSL vhost, if it's on a path that's not parsed by Apache.

    fix dns-rfc2136 plugin not respecting cnames (#5101)
    
    * fix dns-rfc2136 plugin not respecting cnames
    
    The plugin does not work if the domain of a certificate is found to have a cname record in dns.
    That is because when plugin tries to find zone boundary, it searches from the domain up for the SOA record, and each DNS response is checked for the answer being empty, assuming that empty answer means no SOA record is present and the higher level domain has to be checked, and non empty answer section means that this domain is a zone root.
    However, if the initial domain, or any upper level domain except the zone root has a cname record pointing to the zone root, then the server will, instead of returning an empty answer, return one containing two records, first a cname pointing to the zone root, then the SOA record of zone root, and that will make the check fail and use a wrong domain as a zone name during update.
    Fix that by replacing a check for empty answer with explicitly searching in response's answer section for a SOA record matching the domain that is being checked.

    Simplify and stop repeating knowledge by hard-coding timeout into HttpsGetter.get().
    
    Also, switch timeout to 30 so it has every opportunity to actually work, even in bad network weather. (I posit that people are used to 30-second timeouts.)
    
    Stop catching URLError explicitly, since it's a subclass of the already-caught IOError.

    #4435. CLI Argument Default Organization (#5037)
    
    * Enhancement #4435. Organizing defaults in prepare_and_parse_args()
    
    * Playing fast and loose with tox.
    
    Discovered screwy case involving flag_default returning empty list (domains)
    
    * Setting defaults for more low-hanging fruit. Some caveats remain.
    
    * key_path default to None
    
    * Applying PR feedback: explicit defaults even where redundant
    
    * Obsessive quote consistency
    
    * Set testing config path arguments to a 'certonly' default
    
    * Copy the default domains list rather than get reference
    
    * Build a testing Config from CLI_DEFAULTS
    
    * Update some email tests for use with defaults in config.
    
    config.email and config.noninteractive_mode in these tests
    used to be magic-mock'd, so were True-ish. The default
    email is now None and default noninteractive_mode is
    False, so update in tests accordingly.
    
    * Lint...
    
    * Copy anything retrieved using flag_defaults. Apply this to test_cli_ini_domains too.
    
    * Put those quotes back. Backslashes are just the worst.
    
    * Remove vestigial line
    
    * A test to ensure no regressions around modifying CLI_DEFAULTS

    Test farm improvements (#5088)
    
    * prevent regressions of #5082
    
    * Fix test_leauto_upgrades.sh
    
    test_leauto_upgrades.sh has been incorrectly been succeeding because while peep
    doesn't work with newer versions of pip and letsencrypt-auto would crash,
    the output included the version number so we reported the test as passing.
    This updates letsencrypt-auto to the oldest version that still works for the
    purpose of the test and sets pipefail so errors are properly reported.
    
    * Test symlink creation in test_leauto_upgrades.sh
    
    * Pin dependencies in test_sdists.sh.
    
    * Fix permissions errors in test_tests.sh

commit 82d0ff1df249cdd6748b95aab73ec4aa19b24cb6
Author: Brad Warren <bmw@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   2017-09-07 17:23:57 -0700

    Fix permissions error when upgrading certbot-auto. (#5086)
    
    Now we always check if we have root access if --cb-auto-has-root is not given
    on the command line. This allows certbot-auto to properly acquire root when
    upgrading from an older version. People upgrading from 0.18.0 to 0.18.1 may
    check for root access twice, however, if root's user ID is 0, this check is
    essentially a noop. If root's user ID is not 0, we'll request root access a 2nd
    time during this upgrade.

    #4071 Mixin to prevent setting return_value after initializing certain Mock objects (#4963)
    
    * Addressing #4071 Wrote an ImmutableReturnMixin to prevent developers overriding return_value in certain Mock objects
    
    * Language
    
    * Loosening the assumption that underlying _mock objects need to be Immutable-like simplifies implementation
    
    * Addressing #4071
    
    * Ensure side_effects and return_values are pushed down to the underlying _mock in FreezableMocks. And IDisplay mocks are no longer frozen in _create_get_utility_mock()
    
    * Edit a handful of tests to not override the mock_get_utility return_value
    
    * Brief explainer of FreezableMock.__setattr__
    
    * Incorporating PR feedback and some compatibility
    
    * FreezableMock __getattr__ needs a shortcut in case of return_value or side_effect
    
    * Changing return_value only forbidden if set before freezing
    
    * Remove unnecessary else block
    
    * Expanded doc strings
    
    * Bring a couple new tests in line with patch_get_utility() norms

    Change certbot-auto's installation path to /opt (#4970)
    
    * Update comment about root usage.
    
    * run all of certbot-auto as root
    
    * remove other $SUDO uses from template
    
    * remove $SUDO usage from bootstrappers
    
    * default venv path = /opt/eff.org/certbot/venv
    
    * Create symlinks from old default venvs
    
    * Delete old venv path when it exists.
    
    Also, quote expansion of paths.
    
    * fix typo
    
    * Separate venv_dir and le_auto_path
    
    * Deduplicate code with test_dirs()
    
    * Ignore cleanup errors.
    
    This is caused by subdirectories being owned by root.
    
    * Split test into test_phase2_upgrade.
    
    * Rename test_dirs to temp_paths for clarity.
    
    * Check both venvs before bootstrapping again.
    
    * Use OLD_VENV_PATH/bin
    
    * Preserve environment with sudo.
    
    * Remove "esp. under sudo" comment.
    
    * Export *VENV_PATH.
    
    * Change check for OLD_VENV installation.
    
    This approach better handles manually set VENV_PATH values.
    
    * Remove SUDO_ENV.
    
    * Print message before requesting root privileges.
    
    * Make a function for selecting root auth method.
    
    * Address @erikrose's feedback.

    Pin dependencies in compatibility tests. (#5004)
    
    We now use tools/pip_install_editable.sh which installs our packages using the
    pinned versions from certbot-auto.
    
    We also use letsencrypt-auto-source/letsencrypt-auto instead of certbot-auto in
    the root to:
    
    1. Make sure OS bootstrappers are up to date with master.
    2. Copy letsencrypt-auto-source into our tree so it can be used by
    tools/pip_install_editable.sh later.

    client: allow callers to add information to the user agent (#4690)
    
    This change introduces a new flag to allow callers to add information to
    the user agent without replacing it entirely.
    
    This allows people re-packaging or wrapping Certbot to influence its user
    agent string. They may which to do this so that stats/metrics related to
    their distribution are available to boulder.
    
    This is beneficial for both the Certbot team and the party re-packaging
    Certbot as it allows the custom user agent to match the Certbot user
    agent as closely as possible, allowing data about use of the re-packaged
    version to be collected along side or separately from vanilla certbot.

    Align domain names output to command line input (#4874)
    
    The command line takes a comma separated list of domain names. To be able to use the list of existing domain names it would be helpful to get a list that is also comma separated.
    
    Sample use case: If you would like to add a new domain to an existing certificate you need to list all existing domain names.
    
    Makes certbot certificates use comma-separated domain names instead of space-separated.

    Hide exceptions that occur during session.close() (#4891)
    
    * Hide exceptions that occur during session.close()
    
    This fixes #4840. Exceptions that are raised out of __del__ methods are caught
    and printed to stderr. By catching any exceptions that occur, we now prevent
    this from happening.
    
    Alternative solutions to this would have been either not calling
    session.close() at all or adding a close() method to acme.client.ClientNetwork,
    acme.client.Client, and certbot.client.Client and using certbot.client.Client
    in a context manager to ensure close() is called. The former means that users
    of the ACME library never properly close their connections until their program
    exits and the latter adds a lot of complexity and nesting of client code for
    little benefit.
    
    * Only catch Exceptions

    Mention that the domain is used to choose filename
    
    The cert filename is chosen based on the first domain listed. With certs with overlapping domains or where some domains are less canonical, it's therefore useful to put the most canonical/unique domain first. This updates the help text to inform users of this fact.

    RFC 2136 DNS Authenticator (#4701)
    
    Introduce a plugin that automates the process of completing a dns-01 challenge by creating, and subsequently removing, TXT records using RFC 2136 Dynamic Updates (a.k.a. nsupdate).
    
    This plugin has been tested with BIND, but may work with other RFC 2136-compatible DNS servers, such as PowerDNS.

    LuaDNS DNS Authenticator (#4605)
    
    Implement an Authenticator which can fulfill a dns-01 challenge using
    the LuaDNS API. Applicable only for domains using LuaDNS for DNS.
    
    Testing Done:
     * `tox -e py27`
     * `tox -e lint`
     * Manual testing:
        * Used `certbot certonly --dns-luadns -d`, specifying a
          credentials file as a command line argument. Verified that a
          certificate was successfully obtained without user interaction.
     * Negative testing:
        * Path to non-existent credentials file.
        * Credentials file with unsafe permissions (644).
        * Path to credentials file without an email.
        * Path to credentials file with an invalid email.
        * Path to credentials file without a token.
        * Path to credentials file with an invalid token.
        * Domain name not registered to LuaDNS account.

    Remove unused help-related display code. When NcursesDisplay was

    Remove unused escape-related display code. When NcursesDisplay was
    removed[1], escape was deprecated. This change removes the remaining
    bits and pieces of code.
    
    Remove uses of unused menu parameters.
    
    Remove unused default_status/default_state argument from checklist.
    (This seems safe because not only is it unused, the parameter has
    different names in the interface and implementation)

    Correct message about vhost ambiguity.
    
    When our Apache plugin is unable to determine which virtual host to use in
    non-interactive mode, it raises an error about vhost ambiguity with
    instructions on how to fix the problem. These instructions stated that we
    require one vhost per file which is no longer accurate since #4706 so I removed
    this part of the error message.

    route53: avoid listing the plugin twice in the UI (#4794)
    
    Without this change, the Route53 plugin is listed twice when running
    Certbot interactively (once under the old name, once under the new name).
    
    This change ensures only the new name is shown, while maintaining hidden
    backwards compatibility with the old name.

    Check domains for accidental inclusion of a scheme (#4788)
    
    Currently, accidentally including a scheme with the domain name does not
    produce a particularly helpful error message.
    
    Examples without this change:
    1. `certbot certonly -d https://test.example.com --webroot`:
    
    Saving debug log to /tmp/certbot/logs/letsencrypt.log
    Obtaining a new certificate
    An unexpected error occurred:
    The request message was malformed :: Error creating new authz :: Invalid character in DNS name
    Please see the logfiles in /tmp/certbot/logs for more details.
    
    2. `certbot certonly -d http://hoeveelmensengaveneeneuroomtezienhoeveelmenseneeneurogaven.example.com`
    
    Requested domain http://hoeveelmensengaveneeneuroomtezienhoeveelmenseneeneurogaven.example.com is not a FQDN because label http://hoeveelmensengaveneeneuroomtezienhoeveelmenseneeneurogaven is too long.
    
    Examples with this change:
    1. `certbot certonly -d https://test.example.com --webroot`:
    
    Requested name https://test.example.com appears to be a URL, not a FQDN. Try again without the leading "https://".
    
    2. `certbot certonly -d http://hoeveelmensengaveneeneuroomtezienhoeveelmenseneeneurogaven.example.com`
    
    Requested name http://hoeveelmensengaveneeneuroomtezienhoeveelmenseneeneurogaven.example.com appears to be a URL, not a FQDN. Try again without the leading "http://".

    This change renames certbot-route53 to certbot-dns-route53 and updates

    Testing Done:
     * Run `certbot` with `-a certbot-route53:auth`, verify the plugin runs.
     * Run `certbot` with `--dns-route53`, verify the plugin runs.

    Remove dependency on git from pip_install.sh. (#4770)
    
    * Remove dependency on git from pip_install.sh.
    
    Using git allowed this file to continue to work even if it was moved to another
    directory. This slight increase in robustness wasn't worth it though as it
    broke our development Dockerfile (see #4703), the certbot website's Dockerfile
    (see certbot/website#226), and our test farm tests (see
    certbot/tests/letstest/scripts/test_apache2.sh for an example that calls
    tools/venv.sh without installing git). Rather than continuing to find and patch
    these things, let's just allow this script to fail if it's moved rather than
    propagating the git dependency all over the place.
    
    * Add readlink.py.
    
    This is the equivalent of `readlink -f` on many Linux systems. This is useful
    as there are often differences in readlink on different platforms.
    
    * Use readlink.py in pip_install.sh.
    
    This allows us to work around differences in readlink on macOS.

    Enable unit tests on OS X (#4697)
    
    * Add OS X test
    
    * Fix apache tests
    
    * Use absolute path first so that certbot works with non-standard $PATH
    
    Some tests use a fake $PATH, which prevents invoking `sw_vers`
    
    * Also test Python 3 on Mac
    
    * Set ulimit to fix "Too many open files"

    Handle releasing subpackages not included in certbot-auto (#4758)
    
    This change refactors the release script to handle subpackages which are
    not bundled as a part of cerbot-auto.
    
    The script now allows developers to define subpackages as either being
    included in certbot-auto, or not.
    
    The script then uses one of three sets of subpackages for each operation:
     * The version number is updated for all non-certbot subpackages
       (and certbot itself is handled separately)
     * sdists and wheels are created for all non-certbot subpackages
       (and certbot itself is handled separately)
     * Testing is performed for all subpackages
     * Hashes are pinned for certbot-auto subpackages (including certbot)

    NS1 DNS Authenticator (#4602)
    
    Implement an Authenticator which can fulfill a dns-01 challenge using
    the NS1 DNS API. Applicable only for domains using NS1 DNS.
    
    Testing Done:
     * `tox -e py27`
     * `tox -e lint`
     * Manual testing:
        * Used `certbot certonly --dns-nsone -d`, specifying a
          credentials file as a command line argument. Verified that a
          certificate was successfully obtained without user interaction.
        * Used `certbot certonly --dns-nsone -d`, without specifying a
          credentials file as a command line argument. Verified that the
          user was prompted and that a certificate was successfully
          obtained.
        * Used `certbot certonly -d`. Verified that the user was prompted for
          a credentials file after selecting dnsimple interactively and that
          a certificate was successfully obtained.
        * Used `certbot renew --force-renewal`. Verified that certificates
          were renewed without user interaction.
     * Negative testing:
        * Path to non-existent credentials file.
        * Credentials file with unsafe permissions (644).
        * Path to credentials file with an invalid token.
        * Path to credentials file without a token.
        * Domain name not registered to NS1 account.

    Fixes #4719 (#4737)
    
    * Automatically delete temp log file when not used.
    
    This allows close() calls in logging.shutdown() to cause the file to be
    deleted when no logging output has been written to the file.
    
    * Make certbot.log.MemoryHandler.flush() a noop.
    
    This causes MemoryHandler.flush() calls in logging.shutdown to be a noop,
    allowing us to control when the handler is actually flushed. This prevents log
    records from being sent to a temporary file handler for things like
    `certbot --version`.
    
    * Keep reference to certbot.log.MemoryHandler.target
    
    In Python 2.7+, the logging module only keeps weak references to created
    logging handlers. Because of this, the MemoryHandler's target will not be
    properly flushed and closed when logging.shutdown() is called on program exit
    unless we keep a reference to it in the MemoryHandler.
    
    * Fixes #4719.
    
    This completes the changes necessary to fix #4719. Now temporary log files are
    not created if sys.exit() is called before logging is fully set up. These files
    are still created if Certbot crashes for any other reason.
    
    * Document pre_arg_parse_except_hook args.

    Fix defaults on older systems (#4691)
    
    * Creates SupportedChallengesAction
    
    This fixes #3987 as the call to set_by_default can be removed entirely.
    Additionally, logger.warning can be used rather than writing to stderr directly
    because #3184 has been resolved and we're guaranteed to having logging setup.
    
    * Move validator to SupportedChallengesAction
    
    supported_challenges_validator was moved to SupportedChallengesAction so
    argparse.ArgumentError can be easily used to provide nice error output. Tests
    in standalone_test.py were also updated so the module still has 100% test
    coverage.
    
    * Better document ArgumentError usage

    Move 'jwk' and 'alg' fields to protected header. (#4677)
    
    * Move 'jwk' and 'alg' fields to protected header.
    
    Previously, these were in the unprotected JWS header, which Boulder currently
    allows. However, the next version of the spec doesn't allow anything in the
    unprotected header. Moving these fields now allows server implementers who are
    implementing the Certbot/Boulder version of ACME
    (https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/master/docs/acme-divergences.md) to
    use JOSE libraries that don't support unprotected headers.
    
    Fixes #4417.
    
    * Only protect existing headers.

commit 71451dd54b6d2e7eab6ba8f075240a13b303e86e
Author: Zach Shepherd <zjs@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   2017-05-11 15:49:34 -0700

    security: preserve permissions on renewal conf (#4430)
    
    Ensure that permissions are preserved when renewal data is written to
    conf files. This allows users to limit access to the file, if they wish.
    
    Testing done:
     * `tox -e py27`
     * `tox -e lint`
     * Manual Testing
        * Got a new certificate. Restricted the permissions on the renewal
          conf. Renewed the certificate. Verified that the new renewal conf
          permissions matched.

    Cloudflare DNS Authenticator
    
    Implement an Authenticator which can fulfill a dns-01 challenge using the
    Cloudflare API. Applicable only for domains using Cloudflare for DNS.
    
    Testing Done:
     * `tox -e py27`
     * `tox -e lint`
     * Manual testing:
        * Used `certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare -d`, specifying a
          credentials file as a command line argument. Verified that a
          certificate was successfully obtained without user interaction.
        * Used `certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare -d`, without specifying a
          credentials file as a command line argument. Verified that the user
          was prompted and that a certificate was successfully obtained.
        * Used `certbot certonly -d`. Verified that the user was prompted for
          a credentials file after selecting cloudflare interactively and
          that a certificate was successfully obtained.
        * Used `certbot renew --force-renewal`. Verified that certificates
          were renewed without user interaction.
     * Negative testing:
        * Path to non-existent credentials file.
        * Credentials file with unsafe permissions (644).
        * Credentials file missing e-mail address.
        * Credentials file with blank API key.
        * Credentials file with incorrect e-mail address.
        * Credentials file with malformed API key.
        * Credentials file with invalid API key.
        * Domain name not registered to Cloudflare account.

    Enhance display.util to support input validation (#4372)
    
    * display: support validation of user input
    
    To avoid each caller of `display.input` and `display.directory_select`
    needing to implement validation logic, this allows for a validator to be
    supplied as a part of the call.
    
    Following the existing pattern from `webroot`, this validator is expected
    to throw a `Error` when it encounters invalid input. The user then
    receives a `notification` is re-prompted.
    
    Testing Done:
     * tox -e py27
     * tox -e lint
    
    * plugins: update webroot to use display's validation functionality
    
    This change updates the webroot plugin to use the now-built-in validation
    functionality in display, reducing duplicated code.
    
    Testing Done:
     * tox -e py27
     * tox -e lint
    
    * display: move validation logic to ops
    
    To avoid adding complexity to `IDisplay` methods, move validation logic
    to helper methods in `display.ops`.
    
    Testing Done:
     * tox -e py27
     * tox -e lint

    * Use binary flag when writing cert and key files
    
    Add binary flag to mode argument when opening files for writing key and
    certificate files.
    On Python 3 the data buffers use for writing are bytes objects not
    strings, and the write fails accordingly.
    As far as I understand, it the "b" flag will not hurt things in Python 2

    Logging setup before argument parsing (#4446)
    
    Second part of #4443. Built on #4444. Fixes #3148.
    
    This fixes an old problem with code logging messages before logging has been set up. How this works is explained in the docstring of certbot.log.pre_arg_setup.
    
    * add memory handler
    
    * Add exit_with_log_path
    
    * add new_except_hook
    
    * pre_arg_parse_setup++ and remove old except_hook
    
    * Rewrite post_arg_setup
    
    * test restricted permissions
    
    * move changes to main
    
    * Use .name of NamedTemporaryFile
    
    * use better assertions
    
    * set exc_info in except_hook
    
    * Make post_arg_setup more robust
    
    * final cleanup
    
    * Add TempHandler
    
    * undo main_test changes
    
    * improve documentation
    
    * use decorators instead of with for mock.patch
    
    * add inline comment about logging.shutdown

    Fix unorderable types error (#4409)
    
    If the updated datetime collides, the comparator of heapq will move
    onto the AuthorizationResource value and throws an "unorderable type"
    error.
    
    This adds an index value to the element tuple to ensure that they are
    always strictly ordered.

    Move make_csr into acme.crypto_util (#4165)
    
    It's relatively finicky to make a CSR appropriate to pass to poll_and_request_issuance. I think most users want to be able to give a list of domains and a private key, and get back a CSR. This branch adds that functionality to crypto_util.
    
    Note that the two new functions take arguments, and return values, as PEM-encoded buffers. This is a departure from some existing ACME interfaces that take PyOpenSSL types. I've discussed with the Certbot team, and we agree that this is broadly the direction the ACME API should take, so that users of the module don't need to import PyOpenSSL themselves, or use its primitives.
    
    * Add make_csr.
    
    * accept privkey
    
    * Tweak API.
    
    * Remove make_csr from certbot package.
    
    * Skip test in older Pythons.
    
    * Move get_Extensions call under protection.
    
    * Remove assertIn because not backwards-compatible.
    
    * Fix encoding, and use PEM.
    
    * Fix test
    
    * Fix tests on py35.
    
    * Fix error in test.
    
    * Make import_csr_file always return PEM.
    
    Also delete get_sans_from_csr (unused) and get_names_from_csr (newly unused).
    
    * Fix function doc.
    
    * Fix indent
    
    * Fix call of obtain_certificate_from_Csr
    
    * lint
    
    * Handle review feedback.
    
    * Fix test.

    Call certbot client cb_client rather than acme_client (#4357)
    
    In some sense, certbot.client.Client is an ACME client, but it's the not the client in the ACME library and this leads to confusion. Let's make what this is clear.
    
    * call certbot client cb_client rather than acme_client

    Correct info fro FreeBSD
    
    1. Replace the outdated reference to "vritualenv", "see below" -> "see above".
    2. Replace the awkward sentence (partially incorrect) about installing on FreeBSD.
    It can be installed via different ways: "pkg" is not exclusive. I am not aware of any reason why it canNOT be installed from ports. Some people prefer build and install everything from ports. (The previous version of the description implies that ports cannot be used.)

    Dump Boulder logs on integration test failures. (#4442)
    
    Might help debug #4363.
    
    Also:
    
    make "bash" vs "sh" explicit
    move the paranoia flags (-ex) from the shebang into the body
    add -u (fail on unset variables)
    change _common to work with -u
    remove some env vars that were no longer used
    remove shebang from _common.sh because it's meant to be sourced, not run

     Remove Link rel=next for authzs and new-certs. (#4303)
    
    An early version of the spec indicated that clients should process issuance
    sequentially, following Link rel=next from an account URL to an authz URL, to a
    new-cert URL. However, the spec has long since moved to putting these URLs in
    the directory.
    
    Certbot nominally supports either; This change consolidates on always using the
    directory, simplifying things and making the transition to the latest ACME spec
    easier.
    
    * Revert "Revert "Remove Link rel=next for authzs and new-certs." (#4277)"
    
    This reverts commit 11ec1eb91148f6420e10d2296b8a507c90337792.
    
    * Save new_authzr_uri with account for older clients.
    
    * Add test that new_authzr_uri exists in regr.
    
    * Restore backwards compatibility for new_authzr_uri.
    
    * Fix account_test.
    
    * Add test for deprecated URI argument to request_challenges.
    
    * Review feedback.
    
    * Fix test
    
    * Add omitempty to new_cert_uri.

    Make argparse dependency unconditional. (#2249)
    
    The primary motivation is to avoid a branch, giving bugs one fewer place to hide. But, as a bonus, more people get a more bugfixed version of argparse. (To use the example from the argparse docs, people stuck on Python 3.2.3 can get bugfixes that made it into the stdlib only in 3.2.4.)

    Docker changes for easier testing (#4249)
    
    These changes allow developers to run tests directly from the host machine using Docker, and to enable ipdb inside the container.
    
    docker-compose.yml is upgraded to version 2 format. This means that you need docker-engine version >= 1.10.0 instead of previous requirement of version >= 1.9.1. The reason for this is to be able to use custom Dockerfile (Dockerfile-dev in this case) in build context.
    
    ipdb has been added to dev dependencies to be able to be able to debug the code without installing it on every docker run. This is also what we recommend for debugging in the developer documentation, so there really is no reason not to install it with the dev dependencies.
    
    setuptools is being upgraded to a newer version to be able to run coverage tests. This was using the older version of setuptools for some reason, and without the upgrade, coverage tests would fail horribly. Upgrading remedies the situation.
    
    Few examples:
    
    Run unit tests for certbot-apache
    `docker-compose run --rm --service-ports development bash -c 'cd src;nosetests -v certbot-apache'`
    
    Run coverage tests
    `docker-compose run --rm --service-ports development bash -c 'cd src;./tox.cover.sh'`
    
    Run linter
    `docker-compose run --rm --service-ports development bash -c 'cd src;tox -e lint'`

    Remove Link rel=next for authzs and new-certs. (#4194)
    
    An early version of the spec indicated that clients should process issuance
    sequentially, following Link rel=next from an account URL to an authz URL, to a
    new-cert URL. However, the spec has long since moved to putting these URLs in
    the directory.
    
    Certbot nominally supports either; This change consolidates on always using the
    directory, simplifying things and making the transition to the latest ACME spec
    easier.

    Silence Package Manager Output when certbot-auto invoked with --quiet (#3776)
    
    * Add quiet flags to package manager invocations
    
    Add the following flags when 'certbot-auto --quiet' is invoked:
    - Add '-qq' to calls to 'apt-get' in Debian
    - Add '--quiet' to calls to 'yum' or 'dnf' in CentOS or Fedora
    - Add '--quiet' to calls to 'urpmi' in Mageia
    - Add '--quiet' to calls to 'pkg install' in FreeBSD
    
    * Fix $QUIET flag in bootstrappers
    
    - Set the value of $QUIET properly (i.e. s/$QUIET/QUIET when setting the
      variable) in
      - deb_common.sh
      - mageia_common.sh
      - rpm_common.sh
    - Actually use $QUIET when running $tool in rpm_common.sh
    
    * Add handling of $QUIET to Arch and Open Suse
    
    * Add logic to set --non-interactive if --quiet
    
    * Add missing $QUIET_FLAG to rpm_common.sh
    
    * Run build.py
    
    * Limit --help to 80 cols
    
    * Update indentation within bootstrappers
    
    * Add $QUIET_FLAG to second call to `urpmi` (redux)

    certbot-auto re-installs virtualenv when plugin is causing issues (#4035)
    
    When certbot-auto cannot find the currently installed version, output the error to the end-user, instead of not showing anything, and re-installing the virtualenv.
    
    Fixes #4034

    Stop IDisplay AssertionErrors (#4010)
    
    Fixes #3996.
    
    I'm pretty confident this PR solves the problem. I've audited all calls to IDisplay methods and the assertions done in certbot.display.util are now done in all our unit tests.
    
    With that said, it wouldn't hurt to have someone else double check I didn't miss anything. The easiest way to do this is to grep for IDisplay in our code and ensure all calls to IDisplay methods are valid. This means every method call other than notification (because a notification call is always OK) either provides a value for default or force_interactive. This is defined in interfaces.py.
    
    I've also been considering removing the assertion that's been causing us trouble here from our release. The only argument I have for not doing so is it may hinder 3rd party plugin development. When they use IDisplay, they have the same problem as we do with prompting users without a TTY. Not keeping this assertion in makes it more likely they won't notice the issue and Certbot will crash on an unsuspecting user.
    
    With that said, none of our known 3rd party plugins use IDisplay at all.
    
    * Provide force_interactive in _get_certname
    
    * Use force_interactive when asking for webroot
    
    * Factor IDisplay assertion into it's own function
    
    * Add util.patch_get_utility()
    
    * Allow custom path to patch_get_utiity
    
    * Change GetEmailTest to use patch_get_utility
    
    * Use new_callable to create new objects
    
    * Modify tests to use patch_get_utility
    
    * Improve FreezableMock documentation
    
    * Add user facing error to TTY magic
    
    * Comment out assert_valid_call
    
    * Add test_input_assertion_fail2()

    OCSP checking and other cool "certbot certificates" features

    Add openssl installation to some bootstrappers
    
     - The others seem to either be platforms where openssl is part of the
       base system, or where I can't quickly confirm that it's safe to ask
       for installation of something called "openssl".
    
     - If we miss any platforms, the OCSP checking code in "certbot
       certificates" should fail gracefully.

    Take advantage of urllib3 pyopenssl rewrite (#3805)
    
    * pin requests version in py26-oldest
    
    * Determine requests security deps dynamically
    
    Starting with requests 2.12, pyasn1 and ndg-httpsclient are no longer
    needed to inject pyopenssl into urllib3. This change allows us to
    determine whether or not these dependencies are required at install
    time. If an older version of requests is used, these packages are
    still installed. If a new version of requests is used, they are not
    reducing the number of dependencies we have.
    
    * Bump requests version in certbot-auto
    
    * Use pkg_resources in activate test
    
    Due to pip's lack of dependency resolution, the change to use
    requests[extras] causes errors in acme.util_test because pkg_resources
    accurately detects the "missing" dependency.
    
    There isn't a real problem here. The problem comes from a brand new
    requests and ancient pyopenssl as well as a unit test for
    functionality we plan to remove in our next release. I modified
    the unit test to fix the problem for now.
    
    * Use six instead of pkg_resources for test
    
    * Require requests<=2.11.1 in py27-oldest test
    
    If we don't do this, we get test failures for the certbot package
    which is actually a good thing! pkg_resources is catching the
    unlikely but possible problem I describe in #3803 and erroring out
    saying it is missing the necessary dependencies to run certbot.
    Good job package resources.
    
    * Undo changes to acme.util_test

            What would you like to do?
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            1: Attempt to reinstall this existing certificate
            2: Renew & replace the cert (limit ~5 per 7 days)
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Select the appropriate number [1-2] then [enter] (press 'c' to cancel): 1
    
    On selecting '1' (reinstall), the resulting message is:
    
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Your existing certificate has been successfully reinstalled, and the new
            certificate has been installed.
    
            The new certificate covers the following domains: https://<whatever>
    
            You should test your configuration at:
            https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=<whatever>
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    "Your existing certificate has been successfully reinstalled" <-- Okay
    
    "and the new certificate has been installed." <-- Wait, what?
    
    The issue appears to come from assumptions in certbot/certbot/main.py
    
    It uses `len(lineage.available_versions("cert"))` to determine if this was a
    fresh install or renewal, and then calls either `display_ops.success_renewal()`
    (which produces the "existing certificate ... and the new certificate" language)
    or `display_ops.success_installation()` (which has no messaging about existing
    vs. new certificates).
    
    The len(lineage) test isn't the right way to make this choice. The certificate's
    lineage length doesn't imply anything about whether we've just obtained a new
    certificate, because there is no new certificate in the case of a "reinstall"
    action.
    
    The new logic calls `display_ops.success_installation()` on all "reinstall"
    actions, and otherwise employs the existing `len(lineage)` test.
    
    Additionally the `display_ops.success_installation()` has been enhanced to
    accept an action parameter, and has the message reworded slightly to make
    sense regardless of the action passed. The messaging is mostly unchanged if it's
    called without the action parameter:

    Fix non-ASCII domain check. (#3727)
    
    * Fix non-ASCII domain check.
    
    Previously, the code would convert to utf-8, check for non-ASCII, and then try
    to use .format() to interpolate the result into an error message. This would
    generate a second error that would cause the whole message to get dropped, and
    the program to silently exit. The problem can be succinctly observed like so:
    
    $ python
    >>> "{0}".format("ウェブ.crud.net")
    '\xe3\x82\xa6\xe3\x82\xa7\xe3\x83\x96.crud.net'
    >>> "{0}".format(u"ウェブ.crud.net")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 0-2: ordinal not in range(128)
    
    Note for the curious: This problem only seems to happen with .format():
    
    >>> "%s" % ("ウェブ.crud.net")
    '\xe3\x82\xa6\xe3\x82\xa7\xe3\x83\x96.crud.net'
    >>> "%s" % (u"ウェブ.crud.net")
    u'\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6.crud.net'

    When getopts is called multiple time we need to reset OPTIND. (#3475)
    
    Not resetting OPTIND between each call of getopts skips all short args except the first one.
    
    It fixes this automated command:
    ./certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /tmp -d example.com --agree-tos --email contact@example.com -n
    
    Where "-w" was parsed by getopts and not "-n"
    
    * When getopts is called multiple time we need to reset OPTIND. Issue #3459

    Print request and response bodies with newlines, rather than all on one line.
    Remove "Omitted empty field" log, which gets logged meaninglessly for every JSON
    serialization.
    Remove duplicated logging of responses.
    Log the base64 version of the nonce, rather than turning it into bytes and
    logging the backslash-escaped version of those bytes.
    Only pass -vv in tests.

    Update Where Are My Certs section. (#3419)
    
    * Update Where Are My Certs section.
    
    This combines the `cert.pem` and `chain.pem` sections into a single paragraph,
    making it clearer that they are closely connected. It also adds text indicating
    that they are less common and moves them below the section for `fullchain.pem`.
    
    * Update "Getting Help" section.
    
    * Add link to document missing intermediate.
    
    * Remove incorrect line about ordering.
    
    Also remove "(as the filename suggests)," and clarify file ordering in the
    fullchain.pem section.

    Check version requirements on optional dependencies (#3618)
    
    * Add and test activate function to acme.
    
    This function can be used to check if our optional dependencies are
    available and they meet our version requirements.
    
    * use activate in dns_resolver
    
    * use activate in dns_available() in challenges_test
    
    * Use activate in dns_resolver_test
    
    * Use activate in certbot.plugins.util_test
    
    * Use acme.util.activate for psutil
    
    * Better testing and handling of missing deps
    
    * Factored out *_available() code into a common function
    
    * Delayed exception caused from using acme.dns_resolver without
      dnspython until the function is called. This makes both
      production and testing code simpler.
    
    * Make a common subclass for already_listening tests
    
    * Simplify mocking of USE_PSUTIL in tests

    The sudo environments take longer to allocate (#3578)
    
    One more tiny tweak, placing the slower sudo environments back up the list. I expect this should save us another 10-20 seconds.
    
    - there's about a 50 second delay in starting apacheconftest, so move
       it back up the priority queue of jobs to start

    Renew symlink safety (#3560)
    
    Re-do the fix for #3497 to ensure it works in all cases.
    
    * If lineages are in an inconsistent (non-deployed) state, deploy them
    
    * Test new _handle_identical_cert case
    
    * Move lineage.has_pending_deployment() check up to _auth_from_domains
    
    Less conceptually nice, but in the "renew" verb case it wasn't being called :(
    
    * Swap _auth_from_domains return type
    
     * It now matches _treat_as_renewal & _handle_identical_cert_request etc
    
    * Revert "Move lineage.has_pending_deployment() check up to _auth_from_domains"
    
    This reverts commit a7fe734d73a9941fdb7608f6d6f30843a4f43912.
    
    * Move test back to handle_identical_cert_request
    
    * We need to check for non-deployment on two separate code paths
    
     - Once high up in "renew" (because failure to be deployed stops us from
       divind down the stack)
     - Once way down in _handle_identical_cert_request (because that's where it
       makes the most sense for run / certonly)
     - So refactor that work into storage.py
    
    * We don't necessarily reinstall

    Update Nginx redirect enhancement process to modify appropriate blocks (#3546)
    
    * Cache the vhost we find during nginx deployment for OCSP enhancement.
    
    * Refactor to pass domain into enhancement functions
    
    * Add https redirect to most name-matching block listening non-sslishly.
    
    * Redirect enhancement chooses the vhost most closely matching target_name that is listening to port 80 without using ssl.
    
    * Add default listen 80 directive when it is implicitly defined

    Restructure how Nginx parser re-finds vhosts, and disable creating new server blocks. (#3528)
    
    * Restructure add_server_directives to take a vhost as argument. This is the first step towards fixing vhost selection in nginx.
    
    * Save path to vhost in file while parsing in get_vhosts().
    
    * Disable creating a new server block when no names match.
    
    * Make parser select vhost based on information in the vhost it found previously, rather than searching again for a match.
    
    * Make add_server_directives update the passed vhost
    
    * Update boulder config to pass test
    
    * Add testing code for the _do_for_subarray function
    
    * documentation and formatting updates

    Merge pull request #3516 from certbot/increase-log-count
    
    Include log retention count to 1000.

commit 2bdf1258ad9db1a3a0681a3b81614c93a1d5b96d
Author: Jacob Hoffman-Andrews <github@hoffman-andrews.com>
Date:   2016-09-19 15:43:26 -0700

    Include log retention count to 1000.
    
    This is a quick fix to https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/3382, so that
    Python log rotation is less likely to delete files before logrotate can get to
    them. Specifically, if logrotate's config says to preserve fewer than 1000 logs,
    it will do the right thing.

    Remove unnecessary check on registration returned.
    
    Right now the ACME client checks that the returned registration matches the
    registation posted, but there's no guarantee this will always be the case, and
    this only introduces unnecessary fragility.

    Prevent bootstrap-issue on Debian systems with virtualenv package
    
    On Debian 7 (and probably relative distro's) `aptitude show virtualenv` exits
    with 0, since it is a virtual package. However, it doesn't have any installation
    candidates, so filter on this case before trying to install `virtualenv` to
    prevent installation-errors while bootstrapping.
    
    NB, to make this clear:
    
            (0)#: apt-cache show virtualenv
            N: Can't select versions from package 'virtualenv' as it is purely virtual
            N: No packages found
            (0)#: echo $?
            0
    
    Furthermore, --quiet=0 is necessary, to be able to grep through `apt-cache`'s
    output via a pipe. More details on
    http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/201869/why-isnt-apt-cache-policy-output-piped/202041#202041.

    Improve user experience for linting.
    
    Don't run pep8 for directories that we don't actually enforce pep8 on.
    Install dependencies with -q.
    Don't print reports, they make it hard to find the actual errors.
    Remove deprecated fields from acme .pylintrc, they cause unnecessary messages
    about deprecation.

commit a7edc4b1e5ac9f99875ca7bc887d6db4b3415c97
Author: Brad Warren <bmw@eff.org>
Date:   2016-05-26 10:33:18 -0700

    Previously, the script relied on global `pip` for hashing packages. This
    doesn't work if you don't have `pip` installed (like me) and I think using
    `pip` from the venv should be preferred to ensure you are using the latest
    `pip` (which was updated in the venv earlier in the script).

    With us packaging the shim packages, there are more lines in
    letsencrypt-auto-requirements.txt that will change with every release. This
    change strips the hashes of the previous packages before adding the new ones.

commit 2cfcfd6988dc84cf118004f860d926eb024cf1d6
Author: Jacob Hoffman-Andrews <github@hoffman-andrews.com>
Date:   2016-05-23 13:18:02 -0700

    Run Boulder via docker-compose in tests.
    
    This removes a lot of setup code we used to need in order to get Boulder to run,
    and should reduce brittleness of tests based on Boulder changes.
    
    This also unblocks Boulder from upgrading to MariaDB 10.1 in integration tests,
    since changing to 10.1 syntax for user creation would break the current certbot
    integration tests (which run 10.0).

    Hook validation: skip leading spaces/newlines
    
    Improves the situation with #3020 a bit.
    
    Does nothing about other valid shell commands that the current
    validation would reject:
    
      - shell builtins like --post-hook 'if [ -x /my/script ]; then /my/script; fi'
      - variable assignments like --post-hook 'ENV_VAR=value command'
      - comments
      - redirections like --post-hook '<infile command'

    apacheconf: sane sudo letsencrypt (fixes #2800)
    
    - hardcoded
      `LETSENCRYPT=/home/travis/build/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/.tox/apacheconftest/bin/letsencrypt`
      causes Travis tests to fail if running under any other Travis user
      (from e.g. a fork)
    
    - `sudo env "PATH=$PATH" letsencrypt` should make sure that sudo can
      find letsencrypt binary from virtualenv; realpath is not necessary
    
    - sudo is called already from within the test script, no need to sudo
      the entire script

    Changing the method of updating and rewriting renewal config files

    individual renewalparams items individually rather than replacing
    the entire renewalparams dict with a new dict (which may also cause
    a loss of associated comment data).

commit 4be308ac0e669365441c153f7e4f35b24ea64570
Author: Robert Xiao <brx@cs.cmu.edu>
Date:   2016-02-11 16:56:53 -0500

    Support MacPorts on OS X. This fixes #2447.
    
    Notably, this also installs pip via the recommended `get-pip` route rather than
    grabbing a whole new version over Homebrew; this allows the install to work with
    OS X's built-in Python or with the python.org Python.

    Disable wheel cache to avoid a class of runtime errors with C-based packages.
    
    bmw ran into a problem on his own machine in which cryptography was built with an old version of openssl, then openssl was upgraded to fix the Drown attack, and the API change (in a bugfix release, mind you) broke the cached wheel.

    Use pip 8 (installed via pipstrap) instead of peep. Close #2596.
    
    This should solve our unicode error (https://github.com/erikrose/peep/issues/125) as well as many other errors caused by pip, setuptools, or wheel being really, really old. It also means I don't have to maintain peep anymore for LE's sake.
    
    Revert the patch that added the InstallRequirements function, since we're back to needing only 1 requirements file.
    
    Turn off all the Travis addons for the GCE le_auto job, since the MariaDB one broke there and the rest weren't necessary. See https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/5759. TheNavigat collaborated on this.

    Merge pull request #2599 from erikrose/setuptools-1.0
    
    Require setuptools>=1.0 in all our packages.

commit 55b63fca0dad0fae439bb3e453856987e37dea81
Author: Erik Rose <erik@mozilla.com>
Date:   2016-03-03 17:09:24 -0500

    Require setuptools>=1.0 in all packages that use the cryptography lib.
    
    When pip-installing any of these packages, pip hit our permissive, any-version "setuptools" dependency first and then ignored all subsequent, more constrained ones, like cryptography's "setuptools>=1.0". See https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/988. It thus, on a box with setuptools 0.9.8, stuck with that version. Then, at runtime, letsencrypt crashed because pkg_resources couldn't satisfy cryptography's setuptools>=1.0 requirement.
    
    This change lets us pip-install our packages and have it work. We'll need to make sure our direct requirements (all of them) satisfy the more constrained requirements of our dependencies. Yes, it is disgusting.

    There's no particular reason this *should* fix #2499, but it changes how pycparser gets installed (to a more modern way: pip vs. setuptools), so it may.

    Use six.iteritems instead of .iteritems for Python 3.

    appear to be used.

commit 3a303dbf40107855f18d05ccc492cf6efc616972
Author: Roy Wellington Ⅳ <cactus_hugged@yahoo.com>
Date:   2016-02-20 00:29:04 -0800

    Use six to make this list + list work in Python 3.
    
    The RHS here in Python 3 is a set-like object over keys; it's
    essentially the same as .iterkeys() in Python 2. Unfortunately, + is not
    defined for list + <dict>.keys().
    
    In Python 3, it's idiomatic to simply list(VERBS.keys()) here;
    basically, take that and use six to make it Python 2 compatible.

    Use a new file for the updated le-auto script. Fix #2456.
    
    I prefer to err toward simplicity here. Yes, there's an assumption necessary for this to work--that the shell doesn't do multiple open() calls to the script path throughout the life of the interpreter--but I think it's reasonable. The alternative of exec-ing out to a dedicated update script which then execs back to le-auto has more moving parts (like extra files that we have to clean up) and is longer.

    Turn the root-level letsencrypt-auto symlink into a regular file. Close #2501.
    
    It will always be a copy of the latest release version, 0.4 in this case. (Modify the release script to make that so.) This way, people using the old method of running le-auto from a git checkout will not end up using a bleeding-edge version, letting us work on the tip-of-tree version more freely.

    This commit correctly splits IPv6 addresses into the host and port

    be the normal IPv6 usage.

    Always install the homebrew version of Python. Fix #1437.
    
    Otherwise, we sometimes end up using the system Python, for which we'd need to use sudo to install virtualenv. Brew complicates this by yelling at you if you do use sudo. So let's simplify things by always using the homebrew python, which is more up to date anyway.

    Let --no-self-upgrade bootstrap OS packages. Fix #2432.
    
    --no-self-upgrade metamorphosed from a private flag to a public one, so add a new private flag, --le-auto-phase2 to take its original role of marking the division between phases. This flag must come first and, consequently, can be stripped off the arg list before calling through to letsencrypt, which means the client doesn't need to know about it.
    
    The downside is that anyone still (deprecatedly) running le-auto out of the root of a (recently updated) master checkout will get a "Hey, the current release version le-auto I just self-upgraded to doesn't understand the --le-auto-phase2 flag" error from when we merge this until the next release is made, but that's better than a documented option not working right.
    
    Also, remove a needless folder creation from the Dockerfile.

    If le-auto's installation fails, delete the venv. Fix #2332.
    
    Leaving broken venvs around can, if it got as far as installing the venv/bin/letsencrypt script, wreck future le-auto runs, since the presence of that script means "a working LE is installed" to it. Waiting until a new version of le-auto comes out and running it would recover, but this lets re-running the same version recover as well.

    Fix import ordering s.t. future versions of pylint won't warn on it.
    
    pylint gets more strict about import order in the future, so adjust it
    now to make upgrading smoother. pylint is following the order from
    PEP-8:
    
    > Imports should be grouped in the following order:
    >
    > 1. standard library imports
    > 2. related third party imports
    > 3. local application/library specific imports
    >
    > You should put a blank line between each group of imports.

    Detect any setting of arguments as non-default
    
    Even if the user set the argument to the default value.
    
    This involves a hack (empty_defaults=True) where we shim all the arguments
    so that their default values evaluate to false.  This hack may be buggy...

    Make the new letsencrypt-auto script the main one.
    
    Remove the old bootstrap scripts, which have been subsumed into letsencrypt-auto-source/pieces/bootstrappers. They no longer need to be dispatched among manually: everyone can just run letsencrypt-auto --os-packages-only, regardless of OS.
    
    Make the root-level le-auto a symlink to the canonical version. It should thus still work for people running le-auto from a git checkout.

    Add 2.6 dependencies that were missing from le-auto. Fix #2334.
    
    ConfigArgParse has a conditional dependency for Pythons < 2.7. On my local machine, I had a cached ConfigArgParse wheel built under 2.7, so it didn't carry those dependencies, and the pip freeze I used to determine the le-auto requirements thus missed it. From now on, we'll do those passes with --no-cache-dir.

    Run le-auto tests on Travis.
    
    * We choose a different Travis infra for one of the jobs, as in https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/.travis.yml#L49.
    * We keep the language as "python" so the installation of packages (like tox, which we need) doesn't fail.
    * Override the before_install to disable the dpkg stuff the other jobs need.
    * adduser is redundant with `--groups sudo` above, so we delete it.

    Always install ndg-httpsclient and pyasn1

commit 5d93678303cf3d2cdc69aaa16d3297739a72d3e6

    Make ConfigArgParse dependencies unconditional as well.
    
    None of this is ideal, since we're making the dependencies tighter than they theoretically need to be, but the behavior of the old le-auto makes this necessary to make it succeed in practice (when using LE wheels).
    
    Once we move to the new le-auto (which pins everything and makes setup.py dependencies irrelevant for auto installs), we should redo this using env markers as in https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2177. We're too afraid to do it now.
    
    Similarly, we're too afraid to change how we handle argparse right now, despite that it should be required directly by us under 2.6. In practice, ConfigArgParse pulls it in for us, so we're okay as long as it continues to do that.

    Upgrade half-sign to sha256. Bring back old le-auto temporarily. Improve le-auto's option parsing.
    
    If the new le-auto works well in the minutes or hours after release, we'll make another commit to master that removes the old le-auto and bootstrap scripts.
    
    Close https://github.com/erikrose/letsencrypt/pull/2.

    Remove backported Python 2.7 assertion helpers.
    
    I didn't backport their imports, so they had NameErrors in the failure case anyway. And, because of the docker image, these tests currently are run under only 2.7 at the moment.

    Fix Fedora 23 crasher.
    
    This fixes an "OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory" on Fedora 23. Note that openssl-devel was not sufficient to install the openssl commandline tool.
    
    The current manual-testing build of le-auto now crashes with #1548, but that should have been resolved when we upgraded the cryptography lib and so should go away when we build a new version.

commit 6c05197a43fffe3dcd2c10f41954f8a61aec2134
Author: Erik Rose <erik@mozilla.com>
Date:   2016-01-11 13:01:25 -0500

    Remove mock as an install requirement.
    
    The motivation is to free us of a reliance on a rather modern version of setuptools, which caused le-auto failures for people on Wheezy and other older distros. (The alternative would have been to forcibly upgrade setuptools as the old le-auto did, but less is more.)
    
    Mock is used only in tests, so we move it to tests_require. It will still be installed automatically when setup.py test is run. Give all packages a test_suite so this works.
    
    The "testing" extra remains for optional packages not required for the nose tests but used in tox. However, the extra is much less useful now and is a candidate for deletion. We could roll the list of packages therein into the tox config so as not to favor any particular package.
    
    Remove tests_require=install_requires, which I don't think does anything useful, since install requirements are implicitly installed when running setup.py test.
    
    Fix tests to pass with mock removed. We had to stop them pulling down LE from PyPI, since the current version there (0.1.1) requires mock and explodes when `letsencrypt` is run.

    .gitattributes: EOL=LF overrides auto
    
    The line
    * text=auto eol=lf
    in .gitattributes does not work as expected:
    setting eol=lf overrides text=auto, and works as
    * eol=lf
    or
    * text eol=lf
    
    This is not what is intended, as binary files like *.gz go through
    a CRLF -> LF conversion at commit time.
    
    Use
    * crlf=auto
    instead (which is even understood by older Git versions, which are still in use)

    Rename letsencrypt_auto dir to match other dirs.
    
    Originally, I had it in mind to move letsencrypt-auto inside this dir. However, now we'd like to copy it or link it to the root level, where people are used to finding it (at least for awhile). Since it would be confusing to have a letsencrypt-auto and a letsencrypt_auto right next to each other, we rename this folder.

    After doing so, many tests fail with "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'"
    in letsencrypt_apache/parser.py", line 311.

    Add built letsencrypt-auto.
    
    We're going to keep the built artifact in the tree as per https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/1572#issuecomment-161379131 so that...
    
    1. People's current behavior of cloning from git and running the le-auto script still works.
    2. We don't have a deprecation timeline and process to babysit.
    
    We'll enforce its up-to-dateness with a test.

commit d9cde2b9d3a3a96b2e2f64be8eb17da4fd26f299
Author: Erik Rose <erik@mozilla.com>
Date:   2015-12-17 23:45:51 -0500

    Get the first end-to-end test of letsencrypt-auto passing.
    
    To run it, cd letsencrypt_auto && ./build.py && docker build -t lea . && docker run --rm -t -i lea
    
    So as not to depend on the state of the host machine, the test runs within an Ubuntu Docker image. This lets us sidestep interaction challenges by setting up passwordless sudo. It also lets us insert our own local CA for the mock HTTPS server. (openssl's SSL_CERT_FILE env var replaces rather than adds to the accepted CAs, meaning later connections to PyPI within the same process chain fail. SSL_CERT_DIR seems not to work at all on OS X.) This also demonstrates a way to test across various Linux distros, even within Travis if we like,
    
    Also...
    
    * Switch to an official release of ConfigArgParse.
    * Don't redundantly re-bootstrap on --no-self-upgrade (that is, phase 2).

    Requires chain_path for nginx versions supporting OCSP stapling
    
    --chain-path config is not mandatory, so we require this property if nginx
    supports OCSP stapling.
    
    Alternatively, we could disable OCSP stapling on supported nginx versions if
    --chain-path is missing.

    Better Nginx error handling.
    
    Raise MisconfigurationError on restart failure, so we don't attempt to continue
    with an authorization we know will fail.
    
    Log at debug level the config files that are about to be written out, so it's
    easier to debug restart failures.
    
    Fix https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/942:
    Error out if adding a conflicting directive.
    
    Remove unnecessarily-inserted access_log and error_log directives. These were
    added to make integration testing easier but are no longer needed. Incidentally
    this makes the plugin work with some configs where it wouldn't have worked
    previously.
    
    Change the semantics of add_server_directives with replace=True so only the
    first instance of a given directive is replaced, not all of them. This works
    fine with the one place in the code that calls add_server_directives with
    replace=True, because all of the involved directives aren't allowed to be
    duplicated in a given block.
    
    Make add_http_directives do inserts into the structure itself, since its needs
    were significantly different than the more general add_server_directives. This
    also allows us to narrow the scope of the `block.insert(0, directive)` hack that
    we inserted to work around https://trac.nginx.org/nginx/ticket/810, since it's
    only necessary for http blocks.

    Make webroot usable also when running as non-root (GH #1795)
    
    Thanks to @aburch's suggestions, the logic has been changed:
    
    - Set umask before creating folders and files
    - Leverage os.makedirs' mode option in conjunction with umask
    
    The program still tries to change owner / group, but in case of errors
    it continues gracefully.
    
    Tests have been updated, and they pass.

    Put quotes around variables that might contain spaces.
    
    Bourne does the dumb thing when substituting vars; this helps that. Bash does the smart thing but is unhurt by this.
    
    We don't do it to $SUDO because Bourne takes "" as a command rather than a no-op, and we don't want the SUDO= case to generate command-not-found errors.

    In Phase 2, recreate a venv and reinstall Python packages only if necessary.
    
    * Teach the build script how to do special vars. Factor up file reading.
    * Use a static string for the PyPI JSON location, as it will soon be overrideable via an env var for testing.

Author: Marius Gedminas <marius@gedmin.as>
Date:   2015-12-03 10:22:50 +0200

    Allow older ConfigArgParse for users of modern Pythons
    
    (I think this is a bad idea because of
    https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3025, but letsencrypt maintainers
    insist, so *shrug*.  Also the same problem exists for the versioned
    'mock' dependency, so I'm not introducing a new one here.)

    Add tests to check that configuration is used
    
    The existing tests use the case in which the (configured) supported
    challenges are equal to the defaults, and in the same (now-fixed) order.
    These additional tests check that, if we have configured a subset of the
    supported challenges, then we actually _use_ that configuration.

    Make --no-self-upgrade public.
    
    This replaces --_skip-to-install and is suitable for people who have audited letsencrypt-auto and wish to run it as is, without upgrading to the latest version.
    
    Also...
    * rm temp dirs when done. No longer reuse a single temp dir across phases so the user doesn't have to pass a temp dir with --no-self-upgrade as phase 1 itself used to.
    * Swap stanzas in the big "if" so we aren't testing negatives all the time.
    * Fix a bug in which we ran peep with $LE_PYTHON rather than the python in the venv.
    * Bootstrap only if it looks like we never got to the point of making a venv before.
    * Move venv creation into Phase 2. Besides the practical benefit of ensuring there's a venv if a user passes --no-self-upgrade, this has the philosophical advantage of making Phase 1 more minimal, giving us more latitude to change behavior in updates.

    Add build script for letsencrypt-auto.
    
    Change template language to reference files, saving me some boilerplate over the dict-based .format() thing I originally had in mind.
    
    Put newlines at the ends of bootstrap scripts. It makes the built le-auto script prettier.

    Move OS-package bootstrappers to a private folder.
    
    They're now used only by the le-auto build process. The new public interface for OS-level bootstrapping is le-auto --os-packages-only, which dispatches by OS automatically. That obsoletes install-deps.sh as well, saving some repetition.
    
    Also, switch to mustache-style templating to avoid colliding with shell variable references.
    
    To optimize for the docker cache, we could later add a shim script that sources just deb_common.sh and calls its bootstrap function.

    Merge master in to get up to date.

commit e3ace6f84cc1afd31d1cb5dc6b9bc217cf7e8a1d
Author: Erik Rose <erik@mozilla.com>
Date:   2015-12-02 00:08:24 -0500

    Split large independent scripts off from the main body of the proof-of-concept script. Integrate the bits of the old le-auto script that are still useful.
    
    This makes the script more readable and easier to work on. We'll stitch it together with a build process.
    
    Also, stop passing the sudo command as an arg to the experimental bootstrappers. They will be inlined into the main script and can just reference $SUDO. As a result, stop recommending devs run the scripts manually, instead running le-auto --os-packages-only. This has the nice side effect of making dev documentation simpler.
    
    Name the folder "letsencrypt_auto" rather than "letsencrypt-auto" because git yield endless pain when replacing a file with a dir. Perhaps we can change it with impunity in a latter commit.

    Run RabbitMQ setup during test setup.
    
    This was recently introduced on the Boulder side.
    
    Note: long-term we want to have the client tests run the same setup steps as
    Boulder does, with the same script. This is a quick fix to unbreak the build.

    Test dnf before yum
    
    yum may still be installed (by default in recent Fedoras) and will display a deprecation and migration message. On the other hand, dnf either is or isn't installed and the test will proceed as intended. (dnf is the modern replacement for yum.)

    Check for python2.7 before python2
    
    There are cases where more than one version of python2 is installed, and where
    the default is not 2.7. For example in CentOS 6, it is common for both 2.6 and
    2.7 to be installed, as yum requires 2.6 apparently for some reason.

commit d3806a926cc740497b84c8cd2f6f3cdfe0975b6d

    use boulder's integration-test.py
    
    This prevents the integration tests from getting run before the boulder
    processes have finished booting in most cases. There's still some small
    races with debug ports going up before RPC ports, but this flushes the
    big ones (specifically, the WFE ports), and the boulder devs going to
    fix the rest in integration-test.py over time.
    
    This also makes boulder-start.sh a blocking operation. Now the TravisCI
    integration tests no longer requires boulder-start.sh, we can let the
    other priority of being easier for users to control (that is, basically,
    make it easy to Ctrl-C) take over. That plus the idea that
    self-daemonizing code is tricky to get right, especially over multiple
    platforms led me to not trying to get start.py to make itself
    asynchronous.
    
    Most of this change is code movement in order to allow developers to run
    boulder-start.sh once and boulder-integration.sh many times while also
    not duplicating that code in order to run the tests in TravisCI.
    
    I'm not a huge fan of both the letsencrypt's shell scripts and boulder's
    integration-test.py having hard-coded file dependencies in the other's
    repo.
    
    This, however, seemed like the smallest path to code that would
    spuriously break less. All the designs I was able to come up that were
    maybe smaller changes either had the "starts tests before the servers
    are up" problem or with a "each repo uses another repo's test code file"
    problem. Those problem on top of the "it's a bigger change" problem led
    me here.

    Ensure that mandatory flags are displayed under the relevant verb help topics
    
    Closes: #996
    
    In part our problem was trying to pick a single topic ("paths") for flags that
    become essential in some cases.  But we were also calling _paths_parser before
    all the topic groups had been created.

commit 4cc06106799dafc6b525e433a5d12f61445cce88
Author: Jakub Warmuz <jakub@warmuz.org>
Date:   2015-10-29 20:46:43 +0000

    Remove serve_forever2/shutdown2 (reduces probability of #1085).
    
    I'm not even sure why `serve_forever2` and `shutdown2` were introduced
    in the first place... It probably follows from my misconception about
    the SocketServer module. After having studied the module again, I come
    to the conclusion that we can get rid of my crap, simultanously
    reducing probability of #1085 (hopefully down to 0)!
    
    `server_forever` is used throughout tests instead of `handle_request`,
    because `shutdown`, following docs, "must be called while
    serve_forever() is running in another thread, or it will deadlock",
    and our `probe_sni` HTTP request is already enough to kill single
    `handle_request`.
    
    We don't need to use any busy waiting block or `sleep` between serve
    and shutdown; studying CPython source code leads to the conclusion
    that the following construction is non-blocking:
    
    ```python
    import threading, SocketServer
    s = SocketServer.TCPServer(("", 0), None)
    t = threading.Thread(target=s.shutdown)
    t.start()
    s.serve_forever()  # returns immediately
    t.join()  # returns immediately
    ```

    Add -t to apache2ctl -D DUMP_RUN_CFG
    
    Calling apache2ctl -D DUMP_RUN_CFG on Debian Wheezy (Apache 2.2) will
    open a socket which breaks standalone auth. letsencrypt still won’t
    work with apache 2.2 because it only returns „Syntax OK“.
    Apache 2.4 works the same with or without -t.

    Use PEM for Account.id generation (fixes #1012).
    
    This is a breaking change, already existing /etc/letsencrypt/accounts
    will cause the client raise errors.AccountStorageError ("Account ids
    mismatch ..."). Simple fix: start over by `rm -rf
    /etc/letsencrypt`. In a long run it's a better solution that bumping
    to `cryptography>=0.9`...

    Integration tests: force le3.wtf over DVSNI.
    
    Becuse of https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/issues/985, we need
    to force standalone to one particular type of challenge at a
    time. #895 didn't fix it properly - it forgot about issuance of
    le3.wtf (CSR-initiated), which results in Travis builds failing 50% of
    a time,
    e.g. https://travis-ci.org/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/jobs/85875483#L3318.

    Improve flag and help processing
    
     * letsencrypt --help $SUBCOMMAND now works.
       Fixes #787 #819
     * subcommand arguments are now actually argument groups, so that all flags
       can be placed before or after subcommand verbs as the user wishes
       Fixes: #820
    
    A limitation:
    
     * args like --cert-path were previously present for multiple verbs
       (auth/install/revoke) with separate docs; they are now in the "paths"
       topic.  That's fine, though it would be good to *also* list them when the
       user types letsencrypt --help install.

     - to make "run" the default, we need to add it to the args
     - which means we need to pass that back up to the actual argparse call

    argparse...)

    Rewrite acccounts and registration.
    
    Save accounts to:
    
        /etc/letsencrypt/accounts/www.letsencrypt-dmeo.org/acme/new-reg/ \
        kuba.le.wtf@2015-07-04T14:04:10Z/ \
        {regr.json,meta.json,private_key.json}
    
    Account now represents a combination of private key, Registration
    Resource and client account metadata. `Account.id` based on the
    account metadata (creation host and datetime). UI interface
    (`cli._determine_account`) based on the `id`, and not on email as
    previously.
    
    Add `AccountStorage` interface and `AccountFileStorage`,
    `AccountMemoryStorage` implementations (latter, in-memory, useful for
    testing).
    
    Create Account only after Registration Resource is received
    (`register()` returns `Account`).
    
    Allow `client.Client(..., acme=acme, ...)`: API client might reuse
    acme.client.Client as returned by `register()`.
    
    Move report_new_account to letsencrypt.account, client.Client.register
    into client.register.
    
    Use Registration.from_data acme API.
    
    achallenges.AChallenge.key is now the `acme.jose.JWK`, not
    `le_util.Key`. Plugins have to export PEM/DER as necessary
    (c.f. `letsencrypt.plugins.common.Dvsni.get_key_path`)
    
    Add --agree-tos, save --agree-eula to "args.eula". Prompt for EULA as
    soon as client is launched, add prompt for TOS.
    
    Remove unnecessary letsencrypt.network. Remove, now irrelevant,
    `IConfig.account_keys_dir`.
    
    Based on the draft from
    https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/362#issuecomment-97946817.

Date:   2015-06-30 13:15:11 +0000

    Fix --no-verify-ssl in HEAD, refactor acme.client_tests.
    
    Fix #521 by introducing MissingNonceError, which by shows response
    headers when printed to STDOUT. More sensible solution (a'la #523) is
    blocked by boulder#417 (HTTP 405 response for HEAD).
    
    Split out ClientNetworkWithMockedResponseTest from ClientNetworkTest,
    which improves readability and makes it easier to test (less mocks).

    Travis CI setup for integration testing (fixes #530).
    
    Candidate issues to be addressed:
    
    - race condition: start.sh might fail to start Boulder WFE before
      ./tests/boulder-integration.sh is run (unlikely, but possible,
      leading to flaky tests)
    
    - intertwined build logs (./start.sh boostraps in the background,
      integration test debug logs on server and client side)

    ManualAuthenticator for SimpleHTTP.
    
    Inspired by quite popular [1] letsencrypt-nosudo [2] by
    @diafygi. Together with #440 and #473, it allows Let's Encrypt to be
    used without sudo (root) on the target machine (c.f. [3]). Possibly
    fixes #500.

    Rename the apache config file to match the nginx one
    
    Since both config files end up in /etc/letsencrypt/, if we want the two
    plugins be to installable at the same time, their config files need different
    names.

    Rename the nginx ssl config file to match the final filename
    
    This config file will ultimately exist as /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf
    so we may as well use the right filename everywhere.
    
    This is much easier to deal with in the Debian packaging.

    Don't suggest optional email.
    
    Email is still optional, by the same mechanism, but removing the suggestion to
    leave it out we will greatly increase the percentage of users that supply one,
    which in turn will reduce customer support requests.

    Changes:
    - uses debian:jessie as base image (more lightweight)
    - .dockerignore .git/.tox to speed up build process considerably
    - more caching-aware Dockerfile
    - copy current directory instead of git cloning the repo inside the container
    - /etc/letsencrypt and /var/lib/letsencrypt volumes;
      no need for "if os.environ.get" hack
    
    bootstrap script for debian had to be adjusted, as lsb_release is not
    present in debian:jessie image.

    - README has only the most important infos that a new reader needs in his first minute
      of contact with the project (to decide whether it is interesting or not)
    - CHANGES shall later be a curated change log (== important changes between releases)
    - separate docs into intro, using, project
    - intro docs = include README, CHANGES (avoid duplication)

    talk to servers on non-standard https port (like -s acme.example.org:8443)
    
    note:
    
    I removed Network.server attribute, it was not used (only .server_url is used).
    
    I also removed the sanity-check for the ACME server (so one can use server:port syntax, which was considered invalid).
    I don't think this sanity-check is needed, because in the end, we can't fully check if it is correct anyway (you can always
    give valid, but non-working server names or ports).
    Also, many people will use the default ACME server, which is builtin and correct.

    acme/challenge_request handles only 1 domain name
    
    No other functions inside acme/ handle lists, so
    to keep the class consistent, challenge_request()
    should only handle a string parameter. Iteration
    should be moved to the client, which is handling
    the list of domain names anyway.

    Reduce the matching of REWRITE_HTTPS_ARGS and add query string
    
    If the backreference of the match is not used, it's enough to match '^' instead of '^.*$'. It's slightly faster.
    
    ^ -> Match, if it starts
    ^.*$` -> Match, if everything matches
    
    In addition it might be useful to append the query string with the flag: QSA

    Switched from using urllib2 to requests.
    
    urllib2 is a security hazzard, it does not perform certificate checks against a trust root by default, nor does it perform service_identity checks.
    
    Also, requests has a prettier API.

    reorganize daemons!
    
    This splits out the single daemon into four different daemons (for
    makechallenge, testchallenge, and issue, and for logging), switches
    all but the logging daemon to no longer use pubsub (but instead
    use brpop, which is a blocking queue pop), and tracks the number of
    times that a given session has been tested (limited to 3).
    
    There are also new scripts to try to start and stop all the daemons
    with a single command.

    simplify by removing hashes of random numbers
    
    There may be circumstances where hashing random numbers might be
    useful, but in order to justify it we would need to know something
    about the generator that provides them.  However, checking with
    strace shows that the CSPRNG in Crypto.Random may not reseed its
    entropy enough, so we might ultimately want to use a different one.
    It only reseeds 8 bytes per call even if you read megabytes of
    random numbers from it!

    check recipient string before hashcash to produce more useful error message
    
    This is more work for the server but if we don't do it in this
    order we always get a hashcash error instead of a recipient error
    if the client is confused about what server it meant to query.
    Giving the wrong error in this sense is OK from a protocol point
    of view but quite frustrating for a human being on the client end
    trying to figure out why the server is rejecting its apparently
    perfectly valid hashcash...

    wow, but M2Crypto is annoying! - make a BIO for the public key
    
    It turns out that M2Crypto.RSA.load_key_string() requires a keypair,
    not a public key.  There is no M2Crypto.RSA.load_pub_key_string(),
    only M2Crypto.RSA.load_pub_key_bio(), which requires an OpenSSL BIO
